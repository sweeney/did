      <title>Alison Lurie</title>
      <description>Alison Lurie is not only a part-time professor of English at Cornell University where she teaches creative writing and children's literature, but she is also a very successful novelist. "Her seven novels", writes Malcolm Bradbury, "collectively form a biting record of American social, moral and sexual mores from the early 1960s to the present." In conversation with Roy Plomley, she talks about her work and she chooses the eight records she would take to the mythical island.

      <title>Sir Michael Tippett</title>
      <description>Sir Michael Tippett, who celebrated his 80th birthday three days ago, has come to be regarded as one of the foremost composers of this century. As he tells Roy Plomley, other than a period as Director of Music at Morley College, he has allowed very little to distract him from composition. His output includes four symphonies, four operas, four string quartets and several concertos.

      <itunes:subtitle>Roy Plomley's castaway is tenor David Rendall</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>David Rendall, the tenor, is singing in the new production of Madame Butterfly at the Coliseum in London, just one of the many engagements around the world which fill his diary until 1988. In conversation with Roy Plomley, he recalls how, in only six years, he jumped from being a clerk in the BBC Gramophone Library to singing principal roles at Covent Garden, and he chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island.

      <title>Ved Mehta</title>
      <description>The writer Ved Mehta unfortunately lost his sight at the age of four: "Most blind people in India at that time were beggars, or stayed with their relations like wounded animals."

He describes to Roy Plomley how, in spite of tremendous odds, he gained an education at Oxford University and Harvard, and went on to become a staff writer for the New Yorker, and he chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island.

      <title>Sir Peter Hall</title>
      <description>Sir Peter Hall was appointed Director of the National Theatre in 1973. Before that, he ran the Royal Shakespeare Company and he was responsible for setting up their London base at the Aldwych. In spite of this heavy administrative responsibility, he has always found time to produce many plays and operas, including this year's Ring Cycle at Bayreuth. In conversation with Roy Plomley, he talks about his amazingly active life and chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island.

      <description>Lionel Hampton is one of the legendary figures of the jazz world. For most of his career, he has led his own bands, although for a while he did play with Benny Goodman.

      <description>Raymond Briggs began his career as an illustrator after studying art at the Slade School. He first achieved fame through his picture books for children, Father Christmas and Fungus the Bogeyman, but has since moved into the adult world with When the Wind Blows, in which an elderly couple struggle to survive a nuclear attack.

As he told Roy Plomley when they met to choose his eight records, he has now turned this most recent picture book into a stage play.
