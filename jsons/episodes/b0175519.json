It started out as a lunchtime drama club - and very quickly grew. Anna Scher says: \u0022There were enormous classes - about seventy in a class - and a lot of those pupils were non-readers and so I fell into improvisation by chance. I found that it was a very effective way of character training.\u0022 \n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2011-11-18T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Anna Scher"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b016w0n1","title":"Francesca Simon","first_broadcast_date":"2011-11-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b017c8gp","title":"Robert Hardy","first_broadcast_date":"2011-11-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01753np","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnytn","duration":2159,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
