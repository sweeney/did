From Fred Astaire to Danny La Rue, entertainer Ronnie Corbett shares his castaway choices with Kirsty Young. From October 2007.","long_synopsis":"Kirsty Young\u0027s castaway this week is an entertainer so central to British popular culture he can be identified by the outline of his glasses alone - Ronnie Corbett. For more than 50 years, from late night reviews to prime-time sit-coms, his comic talents have made us laugh and made us love him; a nattily turned out national treasure with a quick wit and a ready smile. \n\nHis success is due, of course, to his own ability but also to two enduring and remarkable partnerships. Along with Ronnie Barker, he formed one of the great TV duos of all time whilst his 40-year marriage to his wife Ann saw her abandon her flourishing entertainment career to sustain him through the vicissitudes of fame and family life. Ronnie Corbett looks back over his life and career, from his days in review at Danny La Rue\u0027s club to his last ever programme with Ronnie Barker - a moment that brought them both to tears.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Music Maestro Please by Ann Hart\nBook: Untold Stories by Alan Bennett\nLuxury: A hammock.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-10-21T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs Revisited","subtitle":"Comedians, Ronnie Corbett"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four_extra","key":"radio4extra","title":"BBC Radio 4 Extra"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"series","pid":"b06myycm","title":"Comedians","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young introduces gems from the Desert Island Discs archive","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p01m5h9d"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2007-10-21T11:15:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":7,"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b00zwlh8","title":"Desert Island Discs Revisited","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young introduces gems from the Desert Island Discs archive","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p01m5h9d"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"2007-10-21T11:15:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":287,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four_extra","key":"radio4extra","title":"BBC Radio 4 Extra"}}}}}},"peers":{"previous":null,"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b011ttxt","title":"Victoria Wood","first_broadcast_date":"2011-06-12T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00827cl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp04j","duration":2136,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
