Since the early 1970s, he has taken on many guises and received many plaudits. He was called the new Brando when he appeared on Broadway, and his Shakespearian roles - Hamlet and Macbeth - elicited comparisons with the late Lord Olivier. Most recently, he has diversified from classical roles, feature films and television plays to take a new path with an all-singing, award-winning performance in the West End\u0027s biggest hit of the year - Miss Saigon. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his accidental entry into the acting world and the pitfalls and pleasures of his profession.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Cello Quintet In C by Franz Schubert\nBook: Short Stories by Bernard MacLaverty\nLuxury: Endless supply of rum punch","first_broadcast_date":"1990-05-20T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jonathan Pryce"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094083","title":"Molly Keane","first_broadcast_date":"1990-05-13T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009406m","title":"Rt Hon David Blunkett MP","first_broadcast_date":"1990-05-27T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009407d","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcq2","duration":2164,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
