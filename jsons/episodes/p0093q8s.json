He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his early life as a boy chorister, the death of his mother when he was just 10 and about his experiences as a foreign correspondent. It was in this capacity that he travelled with the Viet Cong when they captured Saigon, and fled from the Khmer Rouge when they entered Phnom Penh. \n\nHe has also worked as a political and literary journalist and as a theatre critic. He\u0027ll be ruminating on the joys of his present incarnation as Professor of Poetry at Oxford University.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Requiem Dies Irae by Giuseppe Verdi\nBook: Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri\nLuxury: Snorkel, mask and harpoon","first_broadcast_date":"1994-10-02T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor James Fenton"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093q9g","title":"Mary Stott","first_broadcast_date":"1994-09-25T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093q7x","title":"Jeanette Winterson","first_broadcast_date":"1994-10-09T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093q8v","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf03","duration":2269,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
