It all kicked off in 1981; just three months after forming her first band \u0022Yazoo\u0022 she was on Top of The Pops performing her first hit. \n\nGiven that remarkably smooth start it might be tempting to think her achievements have come easy - they haven\u0027t. She found growing up tough, had prolonged agoraphobia and depression and weight problems cast their shadow.\n\nNow in her early fifties she says, \u0022I was always an odd girl, I managed to alienate a lot of people. I felt like a square peg in a round hole in the music industry and created a lot of neurosis for myself.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-18T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alison Moyet"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b042z660","title":"Jack Dee","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b044bcc5","title":"Rene Redzepi","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b043w7xp","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnydm","duration":2041,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
