Born in Leuven in Belgium, he studied medicine and in 1976, as a young researcher at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, he was sent a blood sample of a Belgian nun living in what was then Zaire who had fallen ill with a mysterious disease. On investigation, Piot and his colleagues realised it was a virus they\u0027d not seen before which they went on to identify as Ebola. He then travelled to Zaire to help quell the outbreak.\n\nLater, back in Antwerp, he developed an interest in sexually transmitted diseases and joined the World Health Organisation\u0027s Global Programme on HIV\/AIDS in 1992. Appointed as Executive Director of the newly created Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS in late 1994 his major successes were putting AIDS on the political agenda and achieving a reduction in the price of antiretroviral drugs.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-25T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Peter Piot"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04y9nl6","title":"Julia Cleverdon","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b050yh93","title":"Professor Angie Hobbs","first_broadcast_date":"2015-02-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0505hyb","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny8w","duration":2160,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
