Jung was born in the years after Mao came to power in China and as a child she took part in the Great Leap Forwards by collecting saucepans and nails and trying to melt them down for steel. She was a teenager during the Cultural Revolution and witnessed her parents being denounced and sent to labour camps. \n\nAfter Mao\u0027s death she came to Britain as a student. At the time, she says, she didn\u0027t want to think about the past - it used to give her nightmares and so she would pretend she was from Korea. But 10 years after her arrival in Britain, her mother came to visit. She told Jung the stories of her and her grandmother\u0027s lives and Jung decided their intimate, family history deserved to have a wider audience. Her book, Wild Swans, has sold more than 12 million copies and won a host of awards. \n\nInvestigating her own life and those of her mother and grandmother not only brought the suffering of a nation into sharp focus it was also a liberating experience - once the book was finished, she says, the nightmares stopped.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: But Thou Didst Not leave His Soul in Hell by George Frideric Handel\nBook: First Love by Ivan Turgenev\nLuxury: Snorkelling gear.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-16T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jung Chang"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0084xjx","title":"Nicholas Parsons","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00898xv","title":"Eliza Manningham-Buller","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0088vlt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp041","duration":2190,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
