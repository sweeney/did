His parents died during the war and it was, says Gyorgy, a miracle that he and his grandmother survived in the Budapest ghetto. For years afterwards, he says, he would carry food with him because he was so scarred by the hunger he\u0027d felt. \n\nHis musical talent was his passport to the West and, when he was 22 years old, he fled first to France, then to Holland and finally to Britain where he has lived for nearly fifty years. Of his early years, he says: \u0022There were times when you were punished if you were listening to the radio. That\u0027s when it started to get to me - realising that I was not free. Music is international, it has to be worldwide.\u0022\n\nRecord: Bach\u0027s Andante from the Second Sonata in A Minor\nBook: How To Be An Alien by George Mikes\nLuxury: A N\u0027espresso machine\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-30T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gyorgy Pauk"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00sf7hx","title":"Dame Stephanie Shirley","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00sn7dz","title":"Frank Skinner","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00shfjv","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzr8","duration":2278,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
