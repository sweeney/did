Sister Frances Dominica says she had always felt she was born to be a nurse and as a child would line up her dolls and teddies in pretend hospital beds and tend to them. But a dramatic revelation during her early 20s diverted her and, to the horror of her family, she abandoned her career for a contemplative life. She took her life vows in 1972 and, in 1977, at the incredibly young age of 34, was elected to be the Mother Superior of her community. The following year she met a family with a sick child and offered to give her respite care. It was that relationship which gave Sister Frances the idea of starting a children\u0027s hospice and, in 1982, Helen House opened. It was the first children\u0027s hospice in the world. \n\nFor the past four years she has been fundraising for another hospice - which she calls a Respice, a mixture of respite and hospice \u2013 Douglas House, which is geared up for the needs of adolescents and young adults. Like Helen House, it is named after a patient who made a particular mark on Frances, although he did not survive to see it opened.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Skye Boat Song by Elinor Bennett \nBook: The Earth from the Air by Yann Arthus-Bertrand\nLuxury: Chaise longue with a mosquito net attached","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-08T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sister Frances Dominica"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936xl","title":"Rt Hon Lord Sainsbury","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936vl","title":"Sacha Distel","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936wj","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz3k","duration":2152,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
