One of the most successful musicians of our time, it\u0027s nearly 40 years since he famously encouraged us to Take Five, and so changed the sound of jazz forever. In conversation with Sue Lawley, he talks about his life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: The Ode To Joy (Symphony No 9) by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The Spear in the Sand  by Raoul C Faure\nLuxury: Grand piano","first_broadcast_date":"1999-01-03T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dave Brubeck"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00942qy","title":"David Attenborough","first_broadcast_date":"1998-12-25T10:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00942p9","title":"Clare Hollingworth","first_broadcast_date":"1999-01-10T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00942q6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfrr","duration":2232,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
