Born in Inverness, Charles grew up on a croft near Fort William spending his early life learning how to shear sheep and milk cows on his grandfather\u0027s neighbouring farm. Music was always a big part of life with his father playing the fiddle at home and at local events but Charles\u0027s real passion was astronomy. He saved to buy a three-inch refractor telescope from his pocket money inspired by the Apollo Moon Landings and encouraged by the clear Highlands skies.\n\nPolitics and current affairs were another early passion. He ran home from school to catch news of the Watergate hearings on television, he was a star of his school\u0027s debating society and one friend recalls how he always dreamed of becoming prime minister. His first political allegiance was to the Labour Party, but at University he switched to the newly formed Social Democratic Party - eventually taking a seat for them in 1983 General Election at the age of 23. Now, 20 years later, following various incarnations of the party, the Liberal Democrats hold a record number of seats in the House of Commons and are hoping to become the main party of opposition in Britain today.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Cameron Highlanders by Ian Kennedy\nBook: The Day of the Jackal by Frederick Forsyth\nLuxury: CD player","first_broadcast_date":"2003-10-26T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rt Hon Charles Kennedy MP"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938kz","title":"Bill Cullen","first_broadcast_date":"2003-10-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938k7","title":"Christopher Frayling","first_broadcast_date":"2003-11-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009377q","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz53","duration":2218,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
