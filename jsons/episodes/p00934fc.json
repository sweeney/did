She has won critical acclaim for her interpretations of Mozart and Strauss and has made a series of operatic roles her own - including the Countess in Mozart\u0027s The Marriage of Figaro and Dvorak\u0027s ill-fated water-nymph Rusalka. However, she says her route into classical music was far from straightforward. She grew up in upstate New York, the daughter of two music teachers. Although the family used to sing together, Ren\u00e9e says she was not a natural performer and was very anxious about appearing in public and then, while at college, her musical love was jazz rather than opera. \n\nHer musical break-through came at the age of 29, when she was asked to stand in as the Countess in The Marriage of Figaro at the last minute. Since then she\u0027s appeared in all the great opera houses. As well as the standard repertoire, she is a champion of new music and Andre Previn is one of many who have written especially for her. She has won numerous accolades for her singing including two Grammies and two Classical Brit awards.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: River by Ren\u00e9e Fleming\nBook: The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe by C S Lewis\nLuxury: Coffee","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-18T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Renee Fleming"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935b0","title":"Chris Evans","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009386c","title":"Mary Midgley","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00934fd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0df","duration":2202,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
