An instinctive businessman, he was brought up in a complex family situation with a step-brother and sister who were also his half-siblings and a cousin who assumed a paternal role after his own father died. They were not well off, but they had managed until their father\u0027s death when Gulam was seven. After that, it was a struggle and as a young teenager Gulam would spend the evenings working in his family\u0027s two sweetshops in Bombay. He had an entrepreneurial eye and saw business opportunities to improve and expand. \n\nAfter a brief holiday in Engand he announced to his family that he wanted to expand into this country too. He built a confectionary business here and, seeing the huge public appetite for Indian food in restaurants, started manufacturing it for the supermarket shelves. After a disastrous fire at his factory in 1994, he built up his business again and now makes more than a quarter of a million curries a day. His biggest seller, not surprisingly, is chicken tikka masala. Gulam Noon was given an MBE for services to the food industry in 1994, and in 2002 was knighted.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Nat Bhairav by Shivkumar Sharma, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Brijbushan Kabra\nBook: Long Walk To Freedom by Nelson Mandela\nLuxury: Videos of cricket matches","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-07T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Gulam Noon"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936sl","title":"Judith Kerr","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936rm","title":"Bill Nighy","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-14T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00938gq","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz38","duration":2145,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
