He was born into an affluent family living in London. His father, Major Arthur Frayling, was a successful furrier, and his mother was fascinated by the arts and cars - she won the RAC Rally in 1952. At six he was sent to boarding school, which he hated, and it was there that he developed his life long love of film acting and design. He studied history at Cambridge and did a doctorate on Jean Jacques Rosseau and the French Revolution. He fought his father\u0027s ambitions for him to enter advertising and chose an academic career path, becoming a lecturer at the Universities of Exeter and Bath in the 1970s. At that time he worked on the programme The World at War and he\u0027s since become an accomplished broadcaster known for his work on Radio 4. He won an award at the New York Film and Television Festival for a six-part Channel 4 series about advertising called The Art of Persuasion. \n\nHe\u0027s published 13 books to date with an eclectic range of titles from spaghetti westerns to The Face of Tutankhamun and Clint Eastwood - a critical biography. As well as being Rector of the Royal College of Art, Sir Christopher is also the longest serving Trustee of the Victoria and Albert Museum and is Chairman of the Design Council. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Il Triello by Ennio Morricone\nBook: Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes\nLuxury: V \u0026 A Museum","first_broadcast_date":"2003-11-02T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Christopher Frayling"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009377m","title":"Rt Hon Charles Kennedy MP","first_broadcast_date":"2003-10-26T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093775","title":"Jeremy Clarkson","first_broadcast_date":"2003-11-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00938kb","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz51","duration":2226,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
