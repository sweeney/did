He has spent over 14 hours doing two space walks. \n\nHe flew his first eight day mission into space in 1995 during which he visited the Russian space station Mir. In 2001 he paid his first visit to the International Space Station to help install Canadarm2, a robot arm helping to build the station which was launched three years previously. In 2012 he began his final five month stay in space on board the ISS. It was on this mission that his videos of life in space - including a film of him singing David Bowie\u0027s Space Oddity and accompanying himself on guitar - led to him enjoying a huge following on social media. \n\nChris was born in 1959 in Ontario, the second of five children: his father was a pilot and the family lived on a farm. He mapped out his future career aged nine when he watched Neil Armstrong become the first person to walk on the moon in 1969. In pursuit of his dream Chris first become an Air Cadet, then attended military college, becoming a fighter pilot and then a test pilot, as well as an aeronautical engineer. He finally achieved his ambition of becoming an astronaut in 1992. \n\nHe went onto become the Chief of Robotics at the NASA Astronaut Office and Chief of International Space Station Operations at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas. Following his final space mission, Chris retired from the Canadian Space Agency in July 2013. Amongst the awards he\u0027s received are the military Meritorious Service Cross, NASA\u0027s Exceptional Service Medal and the Queen\u0027s Diamond Jubilee Medal.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-20T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Commander Chris Hadfield"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06rl9s5","title":"Kylie Minogue","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-13T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06sfh14","title":"Patricia Greene","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06s6zrs","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03cg6p4","duration":2144,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
