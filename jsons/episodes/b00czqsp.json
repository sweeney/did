A West End and Broadway star she has performed in many of the most successful productions of the past twenty years, including Miss Saigon, Les Miserables and Chicago. On stage she has left audiences and reviewers breathless at the dazzling brilliance of her performances. But, off-stage, her life has often been defined more by shade than light.\n\nIn this moving interview she talks openly about the abuse she endured as a child and the depression she suffered as an adult. She speaks too of her grief after the death of her \u0022warm and brilliant\u0022 sister Noel last year and of the lasting impact Noel has had on her life. Now, Ruthie\u0027s happily married with two young daughters but, of the dark days behind her, she says, \u0022I\u0027d spent so many years entertaining and pretending everything was alright, but no matter where you get to it\u0027s never enough: you\u0027re always looking for the next thing.\u0022\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Over the Rainbow by Eva Cassidy\nBook: The Selfish Giant by Oscar Wilde\nLuxury: A jar of Hellman\u0027s mayonnaise.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-17T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ruthie Henshall"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00cx1ds","title":"AC Grayling","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00dm5mm","title":"Miriam Margolyes","first_broadcast_date":"2008-09-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00czp57","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzzv","duration":2093,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
