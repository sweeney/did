As she dissected a slice of pickled brain, she found herself wondering whether this was the part that generated a love of Beethoven, or held the memory of a sunny, summer day. From that moment, she determined to try to discover how our personalities and thoughts derive from this slurry of soggy tissue. Twenty years later, Professor Susan Greenfield is now one of the foremost thinkers on the question of consciousness, and a leading researcher into the causes of Parkinson\u0027s disease.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: The Ode To Joy (Symphony No 9) by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The Leopard by Giuseppe di Lampedusa\nLuxury: An endless supply of curry","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-02T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dr Susan Greenfield"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944pn","title":"Nico Ladenis","first_broadcast_date":"1997-02-23T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944ms","title":"Redmond O\u0027Hanlon","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-09T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00944ns","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppg0h","duration":2030,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
