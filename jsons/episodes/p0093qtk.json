Born in West Africa, she spent her early years running wild in the Bush. When her family returned to Camberley and the restriction of English boarding schools, Christina reacted by being expelled from a large number of them. She later ran away from the restrictions of London life in search of adventure on the African subcontinent, and she\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her subsequent travels, the exhilaration of the lone voyager, the joy and the fear.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: One Of These Days by Pink Floyd\nBook: The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran\nLuxury: Pen and paper","first_broadcast_date":"1994-03-06T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Christina Dodwell"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qv8","title":"Frances Partridge","first_broadcast_date":"1994-02-27T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qsq","title":"Conrad Black","first_broadcast_date":"1994-03-27T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qtm","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf28","duration":2043,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
