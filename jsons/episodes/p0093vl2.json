He was born and grew up in the West Midlands at a time where \u0027the Austin\u0027 car plant formed the \u0027centre of the universe\u0027. His father ran the local grocer\u0027s shop until the arrival of the supermarkets in the 1960s, giving Digby his first taste of business. \n\nAfter winning a scholarship to public school, he joined the Royal Navy to pay his way through university where he studied law, before becoming a high-flier in the world of corporate finance. Six years ago he was head-hunted to become \u0027the voice of British business\u0027. Knighted in 2005, he is a regular visitor to Downing Street and bangs the drum for the UK around the world, while sporting his union flag cufflinks. He is known for his energy and enthusiasm, and his charity fund-raising has taken him from Lands End to John O\u0027Groats on a bike. Typically, he will make two speeches a day, while his love of food gets him through the vast amounts of \u0027professional eating\u0027 involved in the job. He reaches the end of his term at the CBI in July.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Wind Beneath my Wings by Bette Midler\nBook: How Britain Made The Modern World by Niall Ferguson\nLuxury: Video or pictorial book of \u0027100 examples of excellence\u0027","first_broadcast_date":"2006-05-21T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Digby Jones"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vmk","title":"Darcey Bussell","first_broadcast_date":"2006-05-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vjz","title":"Rt Hon David Cameron MP","first_broadcast_date":"2006-05-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vl6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0bx","duration":2080,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
