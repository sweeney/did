His work is immediately recognisable and is full of energy, anarchy and joy. An award-winning author in his own right, he is best known for his long collaboration with the author Roald Dahl. In the same way that it is impossible to think of Alice in Wonderland without imagining Tenniel\u0027s solemn drawings, when one imagines Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or James and the Giant Peach it is invariably Quentin Blake\u0027s pictures that spring to mind. \n\nAs a child growing up in the London suburbs he was self-contained, quiet and serious. Family friends remember that he didn\u0027t say much - but that he always loved drawing. His cartoons were first published in Punch when he was 16, making him one of its youngest ever contributors, but after graduating from Cambridge and training as a teacher, he decided his future lay not in one-off sketches for magazines, but in book illustration. He was named the first ever Children\u0027s Laureate in 1999 and in 2005 was awarded the CBE. He lives in London and continues to work towards the establishment of a museum celebrating the history and techniques of illustration.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: String Quartet No 2 - Intimate Letters by Jan\u00e1cek\nBook: Collected Works by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: Arches watercolour paper","first_broadcast_date":"2006-10-01T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Quentin Blake"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093v4l","title":"Dame Joan Plowright","first_broadcast_date":"2006-08-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093v1k","title":"Jane Horrocks","first_broadcast_date":"2006-10-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093v2y","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp08y","duration":2205,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
