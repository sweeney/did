Born George Howe in South London in 1950, he taught himself to play the guitar at the age of eight and by the age of 14 was playing the organ - \u0022dreadfully\u0022! He wanted to be an actor, and got an early break in Alan Bennett\u0027s play Forty Years On. As time went on, however, he found directors were always asking him to play an instrument, so he switched to music as his main focus. He got his first job as composer and musical director for a production of Twelfth Night at the RSC in Stratford in 1974. Eight years later, and still almost entirely self-taught, he was nominated for an Oscar for his score for Richard Attenborough\u0027s Gandhi. It was only his fourth attempt at film music.\n\nSince 1982 he has been nominated for four more Oscars (for Cry Freedom, The Fisher King and Dangerous Liaisons) and three Golden Globes; he\u0027s won three BAFTAs, two Ivor Novello Awards and an EMMY and written music for more than 100 television productions including Bergerac, The Jewel in the Crown, Talking Heads and The Blue Planet. In addition he cornered the market in jingles for daily news bulletins across the BBC. George Fenton is a visiting professor at the Royal College of Music in London, and regularly appears on television arts shows and documentaries as an authority on music.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: On Going to Sleep from Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss\nBook: Short Stories by Anton Chekhov\nLuxury: A piano or, failing that, for comfort a tin of condensed milk \u0026 tin opener","first_broadcast_date":"2003-05-11T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"George Fenton"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937k6","title":"Professor A H Halsey","first_broadcast_date":"2003-05-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937hm","title":"Franco Zeffirelli","first_broadcast_date":"2003-05-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00937jj","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz66","duration":2097,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
