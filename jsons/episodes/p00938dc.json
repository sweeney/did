It was the culmination of a death-bed pledge. He had made a commitment immediately after his father\u0027s death that he would prove the family name by succeeding in the challenge - described by Sir Ranulph Fiennes as the \u0022greatest endurance feat left on earth\u0022. He made two unsuccessful attempts at the ordeal before succeeding in May last year.\n\nHe turned to exploring in his late 20s, but had already shown himself to be a daredevil foolhardy, determined and physically strong. At prep school he learnt the importance of training and practice to develop greater athleticism and, at Harrow, he successfully ran \u0027The Long Ducker\u0027 - a marathon from Harrow, taking in Marble Arch and Little Venice - that hadn\u0027t been attempted for 50 years. After university, he spent four years working at the sports agency IMG and ended up by chance on a 70-day trek photographing polar bears, and the thought struck him that, with organisation, training and determination, in the same length of time he could trek to the North Pole.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Piano Concerto No 2 in B Flat Major by Johannes Brahms\nBook: The Oxford Book of English Verse by Chirstopher Ricks\nLuxury: A six inch nail","first_broadcast_date":"2004-05-16T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Pen Hadow"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938f0","title":"U A Fanthorpe","first_broadcast_date":"2004-05-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938cp","title":"Sir Ken Adam","first_broadcast_date":"2004-05-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00938df","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz2k","duration":2204,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
