David Edgar was brought up in a leafy suburb of Birmingham, but was radicalised during the 1960s and has never looked back. In 1976, he examined the right-wing National Front movement in Destiny, a play for the RSC. It was his first award-winning play and the work of which to date he is the most proud. \n\nHis interest in theatre goes back to his childhood; his parents both had theatrical connections and his father even turned a garden shed into an elaborate theatre. It was here that as a boy he was to star in plays in which he cast himself in the leading role. Despite the shift of politics to the centre ground, he remains committed to the left-wing cause and to exploring the difference between utopia and reality. He also writes for TV and radio, and his plays are regularly performed on the international as well as the British stage.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Cum Sancto Spiritu - With the Holy Ghost by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: An Evil Cradling by Brian Keenan\nLuxury: A piano","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-30T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Edgar"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vbf","title":"Dr Hanna Segal","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093v8p","title":"Michael Rosen","first_broadcast_date":"2006-08-06T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093v9m","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp09q","duration":2096,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
