He\u0027s trekked to deserted mountain tops for a glimpse of the rare Borneo rhinoceros, paddled through river swamps to find the Congo\u0027s mythical monster, and, deep in the heart of the Amazon rainforest, he stayed with the most violent people on Earth, the Yanomari Indians.\n\nAlong the way, he\u0027s encountered scorpions, vipers and a giant catfish \u0022which can take your foot off at the ankle\u0022, all in search of a story. As he tells Sue Lawley, although his long-suffering companions survive the journey, they vow never to travel with him again - not even to High Wycombe. He\u0027s planning a trip to New Guinea - so will Sue agree to accompany him?\n\nSome aspects of this programme may upset some listeners.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Clarinet Quintet in A: 2nd Movement by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: A pair of green, insulated Leica binoculars 8 X 20","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-09T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Redmond O\u0027Hanlon"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944nr","title":"Dr Susan Greenfield","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-02T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944lh","title":"Nina Campbell","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-16T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00944mt","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppg0d","duration":2135,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
