Her romances set in the late seventies - including \u0027Bella\u0027, \u0027Harriett\u0027, \u0027Imogen\u0027 and \u0027Prudence\u0027 - were followed by \u0027Riders\u0027 in 1985, the first of her Rutshire Chronicles. Set mainly in the Cotswolds, they are racy and raunchy page-turners exposing the scandalous - and often hilarious - goings on among the British upper classes.\n\nBorn in 1937 in Essex, she was brought up in Yorkshire and enjoyed a happy childhood surrounded by dogs and ponies. At boarding school she earned the nickname, \u0027the unholy terror\u0027 and having failed to get into Oxford and being sacked from a number of jobs for her inability to type, she turned to journalism before publishing her first book, \u0027How to Stay Married\u0027 in 1969.\n\nShe married Leo Cooper in 1961 and, unable to have children of their own, the couple adopted Felix and Emily in the late 1960s. The couple were married for 52 years before his death in 2013.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-07-31T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jilly Cooper"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07lf8fw","title":"Professor Dame Ann Dowling","first_broadcast_date":"2016-07-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07mw360","title":"Michael Heath","first_broadcast_date":"2016-08-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b07m4gf4","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p042tjm0","duration":2193,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
