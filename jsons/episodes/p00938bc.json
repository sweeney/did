As a boy growing up in the impoverished townships of South Africa, he was inspired to learn the trumpet after seeing Kirk Douglas play Bix Beiderbecke in Young Man With A Horn. He begged one of his teachers - the anti-apartheid crusader Father Trevor Huddleston - to buy him a horn and in return he promised to stay out of trouble.\n\nHugh soon made a name for himself in South Africa but as the racial tensions intensified during the 50s he decided he had to leave his homeland to get a better music education in America. There he quickly made a name for himself with his fusion of African jazz music and became a \u0027flower child\u0027 playing with some of the great bands of the decade: Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix and the Byrds. He\u0027s still probably best known for his number-one track, Grazing in the Grass, which sold four million copies worldwide in 1968. He returned to Africa in 1973, spending the next 17 years working on a range of musical collaborations in Botswana, Liberia, Nigeria, Congo and Guinea. Then, after thirty years in self-imposed exile, he returned to his homeland in 1990. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Lilizela Mlilezeli by Mahlathini \u0026 the Mahotella Queens\nBook: Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: A keyboard","first_broadcast_date":"2004-07-11T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Hugh Masekela"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936gw","title":"Rt Hon Michael Howard MP","first_broadcast_date":"2004-07-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936g4","title":"Joe Simpson","first_broadcast_date":"2004-09-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00938bf","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz22","duration":2057,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
