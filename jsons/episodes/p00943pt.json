He has portrayed A Year in Provence for Peter Mayle, depicted Doris Lessing\u0027s Africa and captured Majorca with Robert Graves.\n\nBorn into a working-class family, his parents disapproved of his two great loves - travel and drawing. In the face of their opposition, he won a scholarship to art school where he was drawn into radical politics, becoming a communist and abandoning both art and family to fight in Spain. A popular figure with writers, he could match Brendan Behan drink for drink, and survived a 30-year working relationship with Graham Greene. Now 80, he says he still has the urge to travel, and continues to draw on his rich and varied life. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Far Horizons by Glyn Boyd Harte\nBook: Times Atlas of World History\nLuxury: Solar-powered Apple Mac","first_broadcast_date":"1998-01-11T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Paul Hogarth"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943r1","title":"Professor Heinz Wolff","first_broadcast_date":"1998-01-04T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943p2","title":"John Tomlinson","first_broadcast_date":"1998-01-18T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943pw","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfwy","duration":2039,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
