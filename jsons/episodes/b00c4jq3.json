He was born in Iraq and brought up in Baghdad but he moved to Ireland when he was 17 to study medicine. He came to England to finish his training and, highly talented and ambitious, was made a consultant when he was barely out of his 20s. Since then he\u0027s been nick-named \u0027Robo-doc\u0027 for spearheading the use of keyhole surgery in Britain and for introducing robotics to the operating theatre.\n\nFor the past year he has combined his surgical work with a position in government - he is a health minister and, on the eve of the NHS\u0027s 60th birthday, he is charged with reshaping the NHS in England. It is, he says, the greatest challenge he has yet faced.\n\nFavourite track: Seven Seconds by Youssou N\u2019Dour and Neneh Cherry\nBook: Yes, Minister by Jonathan Lynn\nLuxury: Pencil and paper","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-22T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ara Darzi"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00c1q5q","title":"Peter Carey","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-20T09:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00c7kkr","title":"Posy Simmonds","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00c4jkn","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp00p","duration":2102,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
