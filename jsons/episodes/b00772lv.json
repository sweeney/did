She was born at the end of the First World War and has spent her life immersed in the arts. Gifted with perfect pitch, she studied under Clifford Curzon and enjoyed a highly successful career as a concert pianist. In the months after the end of the Second World War she gave a concert at Belsen to inmates who were recovering in its hospital wing and, a couple of years later, she was chosen to be the soloist in the world\u0027s first ever televised concert for the BBC. She was also one half of a cultural \u0027it\u0027 couple - for more than 50 years she was married to the poet Sir Stephen Spender. They had met at a literary lunch he was hosting and became friends after Natasha stayed behind to help him with the washing up. They were friends with many of the greats of the past century, including T S Eliot, Stravinsky and Leonard Bernstein. She is now the executor to Sir Stephen\u0027s very considerable estate and is writing her own memoirs. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: 1st movement of String Quintet in G Minor by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \nBook: Desert Islands: An Anthology by Walter de la Mare \nLuxury: Her grand piano.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-07T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lady Natasha Spender"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093trk","title":"Anthony Horowitz","first_broadcast_date":"2006-12-31T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tr3","title":"Edna O\u0027Brien","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-14T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b006rxxz","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp07p","duration":2156,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
