The story of a poor black girl surviving in the deep American south, between the wars, it is a landmark work, disturbing and exhilarating in equal measure.\n\nIf one subscribes to the idea that \u0022art is a wound turned to light\u0022, then Alice Walker\u0027s early life proved crucial to her future creations. Shot and blinded in one eye by her brother\u0027s BB gun it was through the isolation of her injury that she began to write. She once described poetry as \u0022medicine\u0022.\n\nShe has also said, \u0022I know the world\u0027s a mess, but there\u0027s so much that\u0027s gorgeous in it. I wish everybody could have what I have.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-05-19T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alice Walker"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01sd0hy","title":"Damien Hirst","first_broadcast_date":"2013-05-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01slqck","title":"Deborah Bull","first_broadcast_date":"2013-05-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01shs3d","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnykl","duration":2070,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
