There may be bad players or bad singers but I don\u0027t like the idea of inferior music\u0022.\n\nThe producer was Isabel Sargent.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-01-13T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Martin Carthy"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01pnlt4","title":"Sir Howard Stringer","first_broadcast_date":"2013-01-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01pz593","title":"Beryl Vertue","first_broadcast_date":"2013-01-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01pt8br","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnym3","duration":2054,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
