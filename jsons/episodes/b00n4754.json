As a child he found he had a knack for impressions, a talent which led him to work on Spitting Image. Recently he has also found success in films, but is best known for the comic monster he created - Alan Partridge. The chatshow host in Pringle jumper and slacks made us cringe with his crass questions and witless interventions and has remained one of our most enduring comic anti-heroes.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: We Have All the Time in the World by Louis Armstrong\nBook: The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne\nLuxury: Fully-restored Morris Minor Traveller with wooden detail.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-11T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Steve Coogan"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00mz6jq","title":"Dame Ellen MacArthur","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00n6x78","title":"Jan Pienkowski","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00n473n","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzvk","duration":2142,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
