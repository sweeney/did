He had already been nominated for the Booker Prize three times when he published a historical novel that many said should not have been eligible for the contest. It told the story of one man, Oskar Schindler, who risked his life and lost his fortune to save more than a thousand Jews. Schindler\u0027s Ark not only won the prize, it has been the best-selling Booker winner ever and went on to be made into the Oscar-winning film Schindler\u0027s List. \n\nReligion and war have been themes through much of his work and indeed his own life. His father\u0027s absence during World War II helped to create a serious-minded child who went on to train for the priesthood. But just weeks before his ordination he quit the church, picked up his pen and started writing.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Herz und Mund und Tat Und Leben- Heart \u0026 Mind \u0026 Deed \u0026 Life by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Collected Plays by George Bernard Shaw\nLuxury: Can of Beluga caviar, spoon and tin opener.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-07-22T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Thomas Keneally"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007snc7","title":"Oliver Postgate","first_broadcast_date":"2007-07-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007tw2p","title":"Nicola Horlick","first_broadcast_date":"2007-07-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b007t9p8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp059","duration":2148,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
