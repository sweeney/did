He is one of the most celebrated tenors in the world and one half of opera\u0027s golden couple; his wife is the soprano Angela Gheorghiu. Yet, his is not a voice that was honed through early years in a conservatoire. He was brought up in Paris in a family of keen amateur musicians. He used to sing in nightclubs and in those early years, he says, the world of opera was, to him, no more than an impossible dream.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: One Day from the Immortal Heights by Giuseppe Verdi\nBook: The works by Victor Hugo\nLuxury: Guitar.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-08-16T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Roberto Alagna"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00lxvkz","title":"Dame Joan Bakewell","first_broadcast_date":"2009-08-09T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00mtqyr","title":"Barry Manilow","first_broadcast_date":"2009-09-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00m0jkj","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzvx","duration":2241,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
