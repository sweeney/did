Though his professional debut took place some 36 years ago, Mr Dodd still proclaims himself a mere spring chicken of 35 or, at a pinch, 36. As befits most jesters, he has had his share of troubles along with the laughter. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his library of books on humour, the loyalty of his audience through good and bad times and his early years in Knotty Ash, where he still lives in his childhood home.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: For The Good Times by Perry Como\nBook: Times Atlas of the World\nLuxury: A box of scented soap","first_broadcast_date":"1990-06-03T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ken Dodd"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009406m","title":"Rt Hon David Blunkett MP","first_broadcast_date":"1990-05-27T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009404y","title":"Maeve Binchy","first_broadcast_date":"1990-06-10T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009405w","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcpv","duration":2000,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
