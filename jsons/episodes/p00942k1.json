Renowned for her acting ability as much as her voice - she portrayed Carmen as witty, clever and very very dangerous. Her Sheherazade was sexy. While as Salome she brought the audience to the edge of their seats as the last of the seven veils revealed her naked beneath. In conversation with Sue Lawley, she talks about her life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Opening of Prelude a L\u0027apres-midi d\u0027un Faune by Claude Debussy\nBook: Collected Poems by John Donne\nLuxury: Piano","first_broadcast_date":"1999-02-21T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Maria Ewing"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00942kw","title":"Nina Cassian","first_broadcast_date":"1999-02-14T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00942jd","title":"Richard Curtis","first_broadcast_date":"1999-02-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00942k3","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfr3","duration":2145,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
