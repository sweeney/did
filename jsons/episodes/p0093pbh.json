Aged 91, Max Nicholson has enjoyed careers in conservation, politics, journalism and the Civil Service.\n\nBut his great passion remains ornithology. As a tiny boy, his parents took him one rainy afternoon to see the stuffed birds in the Natural History Museum, and there his great obsession was born. He was a conservationist before anyone understood the idea of ecology. He\u0027s played major parts in the founding of the Nature Conservancy Council, the World Wildlife Fund and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Symphony No 6 In F Major Op 68 by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The Phenomenon of Man by Pierre Teilhard De Chardin\nLuxury: Binoculars","first_broadcast_date":"1995-09-17T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Max Nicholson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pc1","title":"John Updike","first_broadcast_date":"1995-09-10T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093p9t","title":"Maurice Saatchi","first_broadcast_date":"1995-09-24T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pbk","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdv6","duration":2455,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
