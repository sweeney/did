But she is also used to far more earthy roles - one of her first television performances was portraying the real-life story of a deaf\/mute prostitute from Bradford for which she won a TV Critics\u0027 award. The TV role she took after Jewel in the Crown was as the redoubtable and beefy Lady Maud in Blott on the Landscape and, later, more northern prostitutes in Band of Gold. \n\nShe is a well respected stage actress - key roles include Portia in the Merchant of Venice opposite Dustin Hoffman and When I Was a Girl I Used to Scream and Shout. Her most recent screen work was as the prim and disapproving Women\u0027s Institute leader in the hugely successful film Calendar Girls. After school she studied drama at the Drama Centre, London, and spent three years in repertory theatre and school theatre before embarking on her television career; most recently as Lady Rowley in Trollope\u0027s He Knew He was Right. She was made an OBE in 2003.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: In Tears of Grief, Dear Lord We Leave Thee by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: The Fatal Shore by Robert Hughes\nLuxury: iPod","first_broadcast_date":"2004-05-30T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Geraldine James"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938cp","title":"Sir Ken Adam","first_broadcast_date":"2004-05-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936jm","title":"Karan Bilimoria","first_broadcast_date":"2004-06-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936kk","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz2d","duration":2207,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
