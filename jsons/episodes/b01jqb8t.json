In the years since, her campaigning has resulted in a shift in public attitudes, laws being changed and policing methods overhauled. She set up a charity in her son\u0027s memory and has been awarded an OBE for services to community relations. \n\nShe says: \u0022My son was special and I think, what happened to him, I just wanted everyone to know and learn about him - but all the other things, the OBE, I\u0027d swap all of that just to have my son back. When your children are young you take them for granted, because you think they\u0027re going to be there forever.\u0022\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-06-10T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Doreen Lawrence"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01jgb8t","title":"Margaret Rhodes","first_broadcast_date":"2012-06-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01jwfpz","title":"Ahdaf Soueif","first_broadcast_date":"2012-06-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01jq9zx","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnypz","duration":2187,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
