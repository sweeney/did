He has always been driven to try to demystify and popularise his field. It\u0027s clearly a task he takes seriously - his father has recently enrolled on an Open University course in maths and, he admits, when he took his young son to visit the Alhambra in Spain, he challenged him to find the 17 forms of plane symmetry in the palace.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Prelude to Parsifal by Richard Wagner\nBook: The Glass Bead Game by Hermann Hesse\nAlternative to Bible: Mahabharata\nLuxury: My own trumpet.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-12-07T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Marcus du Sautoy"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00fn89g","title":"Michael Eavis","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00fy2fg","title":"Michael Deeley","first_broadcast_date":"2008-12-14T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00frmkp","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzyw","duration":2291,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
