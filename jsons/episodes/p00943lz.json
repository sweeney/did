His thirst for speed began when he was six years old and saw John Cobb\u0027s jet boat Crusader. Then, in the 1970s, he built his own jet-propelled car in his garage at home. He called it Thrust One, and wrote it off at over 200 miles per hour. Nine years later, he broke the land speed record with Thrust Two, reaching speeds greater than a Boeing 747. Last year he watched as his team, with Andy Green behind the wheel, broke the sound barrier.\n\nNow firmly established alongside other champions of speed like John Cobb and Malcolm and Donald Campbell, Richard Noble chooses his Desert Island Discs.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: The Dambusters March by The Central Band of the RAF\nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: Guitar","first_broadcast_date":"1998-02-15T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Richard Noble"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943mk","title":"Colin Dexter","first_broadcast_date":"1998-02-01T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943l7","title":"David Pountney","first_broadcast_date":"1998-02-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943m1","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfwk","duration":2172,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
