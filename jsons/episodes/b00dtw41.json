A writer, comic and actor, Sanjeev has brought the British Asian experience into mainstream comedy with his television programmes Goodness Gracious Me and The Kumars at No 42. Despite initial worries from the broadcasters, both attracted a loyal following and great critical acclaim.\n\nThis represented a turn-around in Sanjeev\u0027s fortunes: aged 30, he had been unemployed, single, depressed and living at home. Now he is enjoying great success professionally and is one half of a golden couple of entertainment - he is married to fellow writer and performer Meera Syal. \u0022At times,\u0022 he says, \u0022it\u0027s felt like living someone else\u0027s life. But I\u0027m not going to give it back to whoever owns it legitimately.\u0022\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Waters of March by Susannah McCorkle\nBook: The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams\nLuxury: A grand piano.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-10-12T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sanjeev Bhaskar"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00dqctb","title":"David McVicar","first_broadcast_date":"2008-10-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00dybps","title":"Randy Newman","first_broadcast_date":"2008-10-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00dtvbg","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzzl","duration":2097,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
