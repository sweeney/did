It\u0027s 29 years since she first appeared at the festival; back then she was a new-born being carried through the crowd in swaddling. Indeed, she was as good as baptised at the font of celebrity culture - her dad, Keith, is an actor and writer, her mum, Alison, is an award-winning film producer - for a time her step-dad was Harry Enfield. So, it seems almost inevitable that she\u0027s ended up at the centre of a media-saturated life.\n\nExcept that in all likelihood she would have been propelled there entirely by her own endeavours: her lyrics are witty and wise-ass and capture concisely what it is to be a savvy, young woman today. \n\nShe says, \u0022the only thing I can do really is write lyrics and the only way I know how to do that is by being honest and doing it with integrity because otherwise there\u0027s no point\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-29T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lily Allen"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0474yct","title":"Judy Murray","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-22T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b048j630","title":"Sir Michael Marmot","first_broadcast_date":"2014-07-06T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b047w8q8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyct","duration":2120,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
