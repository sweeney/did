The chief executive of British Telecommunications, it is said that when he left his previous company, its Japanese owner presented him with a samurai sword and helmet to remind him of the warrior qualities he would need at BT. And certainly the challenges facing him in this fast moving industry have tested all his discipline and determination - qualities he says he learnt as a boy at the local convent school.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: American Pie by Don McLean\nBook: A book on celestial navigation\nLuxury: A windsurfer","first_broadcast_date":"2000-04-30T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Peter Bonfield"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949zh","title":"Leonard Slatkin","first_broadcast_date":"2000-04-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949y8","title":"Sir John Mills","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00949ys","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnznm","duration":2044,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
