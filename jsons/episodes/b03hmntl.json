From the careers mistress who told her, \u0022black people don\u0027t become teachers,\u0022 to the 82 rejection letters she received before she was published, significant parts of her life seem to have been spent proving people wrong. A technology wiz, her first career was in computing. As a writer her books have tackled challenging themes: bullying, teenage pregnancy, racism and terrorism.\n\nCurrently Children\u0027s Laureate, her own formative years were spent in South London where as a little girl she went from thinking everyone was her friend to feeling, as a teenager, that the world was her enemy.\n\nShe says, \u0022Good stories made me reassess the world and people as I thought I knew them. Great stories made me reassess myself.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-17T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Malorie Blackman"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03h7grg","title":"Alfred Brendel","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-15T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03j8srb","title":"Rt Hon Ed Miliband","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03hmnrt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnygw","duration":2064,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
