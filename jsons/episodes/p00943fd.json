One of his best-known works, The Sinking of the Titanic, pays tribute to the band which continued to play as the ship went down. It poses the question what if they hadn\u0027t stop playing; how would their music have sounded under water? His most popular composition, Jesus\u0027 Blood Never Failed Me Yet, features a tramp singing the same verse again and again, building up layer upon layer of emotion. \n\nComposing is a craft he learnt as an assistant to John Cage, after hearing his work Four minutes, thirty-three seconds - of silence. Today he is both established and establishment - the ENO are soon to stage his latest opera and if you look closely at the orchestra, you\u0027ll spot him on the bass!\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: My Foolish Heart by Bill Evans Trio\nBook: Science and Civilisation in China  by Joseph Needham\nLuxury: Gravity chair","first_broadcast_date":"1998-04-05T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gavin Bryars"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943g9","title":"Alice Thomas Ellis","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-29T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943dl","title":"Judi Dench","first_broadcast_date":"1998-04-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943fj","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfvx","duration":2089,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
