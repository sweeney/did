She is currently the government\u0027s Women in Finance Champion. She worked for Fred Goodwin at RBS just prior to the financial crisis before returning to Virgin Money in 2007. A mother of one, she endured many miscarriages and has written about her experience of post-natal depression following her daughter\u0027s birth.\n\nAn only child, she was brought up first in the Midlands, then in East Anglia. She was one of very few girls to attend a newly co-educational boys\u0027 school where she was bullied. Following a year spent working in an unemployment office she went to Royal Holloway College in London where she met her future husband, Ash, to whom she\u0027s been married for 33 years. Earlier this year she published her autobiography.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-07-23T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jayne-Anne Gadhia"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b08xxfz3","title":"John McEnroe","first_broadcast_date":"2017-07-16T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b08z9b81","title":"Sheryl Sandberg","first_broadcast_date":"2017-07-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b08yqdqw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p0596s7y","duration":2135,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p0599z07","duration":2134,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
