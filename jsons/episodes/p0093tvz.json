Although he was to become known as \u0027the policeman\u0027s policeman\u0027, it was not his first career choice - as a child he wanted to be a pilot but was told that his eyesight was not good enough for him to make it his career.\n\nHis first beat, more than forty years ago, was on Tottenham Court Road in London. He soon moved over to CID and earned the nickname \u0027Swifty Stevens\u0027 for his impressive arrest record. When he took over at the Met in 2000, it had just been branded \u0027institutionally racist\u0027 and the morale and reputation of the force was at rock bottom. He\u0027s credited with turning it around and regaining public confidence. Even in his retirement, he\u0027s continuing to head two major investigations - one into the circumstances around the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and the second into football bungs.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Reach for the Sky by Central Band of the R.A.F.\nBook: Reach for the Sky: The Story of Douglas Bader by Paul Brickhill\nLuxury: Cellar of champagne","first_broadcast_date":"2006-11-17T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Stevens"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tx6","title":"Humphrey Lyttelton","first_broadcast_date":"2006-11-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ttz","title":"Stephen King","first_broadcast_date":"2006-11-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093tw1","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp08b","duration":2212,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
