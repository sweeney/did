Throughout his career, he has been at the forefront of shaping our justice system. Following the Strangeways riots in 1990 he issued far-reaching reports on penal reform and his part in authorizing the release of James Bulger\u0027s killers attracted huge attention. As Master of the Rolls he made an historic judgement allowing Diane Blood to use her dead husband\u0027s sperm to have a child. \n\nLord Woolf\u0027s appetite to see justice done was sharpened as a wartime school boy and the only Jew at Fettes College in Edinburgh - he developed an early antipathy towards any perceived unfairness. His school master\u0027s contention that being a barrister wasn\u0027t the profession for a boy with a stutter only made him more determined to succeed.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Prisoner\u0027s Chorus from Fidelio by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The Koran \nLuxury: A happy photograph of the whole family including the latest grandchildren.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-01T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Woolf"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00bfjzs","title":"Howard Goodall","first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00bydg9","title":"Bill Bailey","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00bvblm","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp012","duration":2059,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
