Goldie is an Academy Award winner and producer who\u0027s been on the A list for 40-odd years, starring alongside Peter Sellers, Walter Matthau and Woody Allen. She\u0027s now transmuted from fantasy pin-up to best selling author - she writes parenting manuals and spearheads a childhood learning initiative.\n\nShe tells Kirsty about her journey from dancing in sleazy go-go bars to bagging an Oscar, how she coped with the difficulties her early success brought her and how she met her husband of 29 years, Kurt Russell.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-09-23T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Goldie Hawn"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01lsts1","title":"Craig Brown","first_broadcast_date":"2012-08-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01n0t5n","title":"Ade Adepitan","first_broadcast_date":"2012-09-30T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01mtsh4","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyp0","duration":1937,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03rk0sp","duration":1937,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
