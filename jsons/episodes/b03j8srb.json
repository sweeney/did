But that fact got somewhat lost in the drama that surrounded his coronation: famously, he stood against his brother, David. To say the younger brother\u0027s victory upset the political apple cart would be something of an understatement.\n\nPolitics is in his pores. His mother was a human rights campaigner, his father a renowned Marxist academic. Both parents came from Jewish families who settled in Britain having only just survived the Nazis.\n\nLooking though his CV - clever comprehensive schoolboy, degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Oxford, an intern for Tony Benn, Economics lecturer at Harvard, Special Advisor to Gordon Brown - it\u0027s clear, for him, there\u0027s only ever been one abiding passion.\n\nHe says, politics \u0022is not something I chose. It\u0027s not something I learned from books, even from my Dad\u0027s books. It was something I was born into.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-24T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rt Hon Ed Miliband"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03hmntl","title":"Malorie Blackman","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-17T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03jyf6p","title":"Clare Balding","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03j8kz3","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnygt","duration":2146,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
