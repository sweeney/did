They published some of the greatest names of the 20th century, including Norman Mailer, Jack Kerouac, VS Naipaul and Jean Rhys.\n\nHer career has been remarkable, but it was one that she fell into after her original plans for marriage and children fell through. Now aged 86, she is still writing and her novel Make Believe is being republished this autumn - and she still visits the Norfolk estate owned by her family where she spent so much time as a girl riding horses.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: O Glucklich Paar by Franz Joseph Haydn\nBook: Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray\nLuxury: Her own bed","first_broadcast_date":"2004-06-20T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Diana Athill"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936jm","title":"Karan Bilimoria","first_broadcast_date":"2004-06-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936hp","title":"Tim Rice","first_broadcast_date":"2004-06-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00938c3","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz28","duration":2251,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
