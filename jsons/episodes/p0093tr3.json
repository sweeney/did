Described as a \u0027poet of heartbreak\u0027 her lyrical storytelling captures the fragility and pain of the human condition, reflecting the drama of her own life as much as the imagined journeys of her characters. She was born and raised in a small village in County Clare, where the only books in the house were prayer books which sat alongside her father\u0027s bloodstock magazines. Her mother thought writing was in essence sinful and tried fiercely to stop her becoming an author. \n\nShe was living in England when she published her first novel, The Country Girls, in 1960. It was a huge hit and was critically well received - but in Ireland she was decried and her book was burnt in the streets. Although she\u0027s lived in London for most of her adult life, she continues to draw on her Irish background for inspiration - she says: \u0022it\u0027s in my roots, and when I dream at night it\u0027s the place I go\u0022.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Foggy Dew (Sinead O\u0027Connor) by The Chieftains \nBook: Ulysses by James Joyce\nLuxury: Vault of a very good white wine","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-14T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Edna O\u0027Brien"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00772lv","title":"Lady Natasha Spender","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tql","title":"Ann Daniels","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093tr4","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp07m","duration":2125,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
