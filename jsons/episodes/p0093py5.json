Currently in her prime as Miss Jean Brodie in the West End, she\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about how John Mortimer selected her for her first prominent role as barrister Phyllida Trent in Rumpole of the Bailey. She went on to portray several aloof, beautiful women, but denies that she is by nature remote. She\u0027ll also be reminiscing about her childhood in Grimsby, where her parents ran a large three-star hotel, making her upbringing a little different from that of her contemporaries.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Candide Make Our Garden Grow by David Eisler \u0026 Erie Mills\nBook: Compendium of Plays by Harold Pinter\nLuxury: A supply of embroidery","first_broadcast_date":"1995-01-08T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Patricia Hodge"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pyw","title":"Alan Clark","first_broadcast_date":"1995-01-01T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pxc","title":"Phil Redmond","first_broadcast_date":"1995-01-15T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093py6","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdyh","duration":2209,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
