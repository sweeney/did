Son of Sir Terence Conran and Shirley Conran, he has art, design and business in his blood and was always determined to make his own way in the world of fashion without parental influence. He has said, \u0022in a family like mine, if you\u0027re not successful, you drown\u0022.\n\nHe\u0027ll be telling Sue Lawley about his difficult childhood of nannies and his public school where he was bullied for being overweight, all of which he overcame to win a scholarship to the prestigious Parsons School of Art in New York. After that, his career took off and, at the age of 27, he was named Designer of the Year. By the late 1980s he was almost bankrupt and had to re-invent his business to a 1990s-type smaller and more manageable outfit.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Tosca Vissi D\u0027 Arte by Giacomo Puccini\nBook: Tales by Hoffman\nLuxury: Vintage Krug Champagne (endless supply)","first_broadcast_date":"1995-06-25T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jasper Conran"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pg8","title":"Sir Magdi Yacoub","first_broadcast_date":"1995-06-18T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pds","title":"Duke Of Westminster","first_broadcast_date":"1995-07-02T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pfh","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdvq","duration":2123,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
