Once known, blasphemously, as \u0027God\u0027, with prolific graffiti announcing \u0027Eric Clapton is God\u0027, he played with, among others, the Yardbirds, Cream and Blind Faith. Dealing successfully with years of alcohol and drug-related problems, he\u0027s still one of rock\u0027s superstars, and he\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his passion for music and his life of turmoil.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Purple Rain by Prince\nBook: Barnaby Rudge by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: Guitar","first_broadcast_date":"1989-09-10T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Eric Clapton"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mdmq","title":"Dame Vera Lynn","first_broadcast_date":"1989-09-03T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mdlb","title":"Penelope Lively","first_broadcast_date":"1989-09-17T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mdm5","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppctv","duration":2235,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
