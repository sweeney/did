Alan Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts would eventually break the Enigma Code and it\u0027s said that this breakthrough shortened the war by two years.\n\nBorn into a musical family, she first took to the stage at boarding school. Pamela\u0027s lifelong ambition to be an actress was interrupted by the war and the invitation to work at Bletchley. Despite finding the work in the indexing section of Hut 4 something of a disappointment at first, she and her fellow workers still managed to have fun and she met her husband Jim at a hop when he asked her to dance. They married after the war and it wasn\u0027t until nearly sixty years later and after Jim\u0027s death that she would finally achieve her dream of acting on the West End stage. \n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-05-31T11:16:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Pamela Rose"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b05vstzl","title":"Jimmy Wales","first_broadcast_date":"2015-05-24T11:16:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b05xcsms","title":"Lisa Jardine","first_broadcast_date":"2015-06-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b05wnqny","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02stgcy","duration":2320,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
