She\u0027s apologised twice in parliament for having failed to appoint a suitable head to lead the historical child abuse inquiry; a minister in her department resigned, claiming working with her had been like \u0022walking through mud\u0022. Then there has been the controversy over the non-vote on the European Arrest Warrant and finally news this week that 1 in 5 crimes are unrecorded.\n\nJust as well that she has a reputation as a woman who knows her own mind and is willing to speak it. She famously said the Conservatives were perceived as the \u0027nasty party\u0027. Her excoriating speech to the Police Federation dealt head on with long-term corruption and incompetence in their ranks and was received with stunned silence.\n\nSo unflinching, resilient, driven and, if a recent poll is to be believed, a popular choice among Conservative voters to be the next Prime Minister. She has, so far, remained tight-lipped on any ambition to lead her party.\n\nShe says, \u0022I think you have to believe in what you\u0027re doing - that\u0027s key. If you do believe you are doing the right thing - that gives you resilience\u0022.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rt Hon Theresa May"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04p5m1k","title":"John Agard","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04stgz0","title":"Damian Lewis","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04pr6q9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyb1","duration":2317,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
