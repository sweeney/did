For 34 years she served as the Labour member for the constituency of Blackburn, and she rose to high office in the Wilson governments of the 1960s and 1970s. As the first woman Transport Minister, she introduced, amidst great controversy, the breathalyser and the motorway speed limit. She was also at the centre of legislation over equal pay for women. Then, 10 years ago, she opted out of domestic politics and into the European cauldron.\n\nNow retired from that too, and recently having celebrated her 80th birthday, she\u0027ll be looking back over her long and passionate political career, and forward to making her mark on the House of Lords.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: I Have A Dream Speech by Martin Luther King\nBook: The collected works by William Morris\nLuxury: Typewriter","first_broadcast_date":"1990-11-11T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rt Hon Barbara Castle"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ztk","title":"Lord Annan","first_broadcast_date":"1990-11-04T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zrj","title":"Elisabeth Welch","first_broadcast_date":"1990-11-18T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zs9","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcmp","duration":2147,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
