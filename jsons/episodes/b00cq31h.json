Born Antonia Pakenham, the eldest of eight children, it was while growing up in Oxford that she became fascinated with the past and would make daily trips to the town\u0027s library to fuel her passion for history. With seven brothers and sisters it was, she says, \u0022something of mine\u0022. Her father, Lord Longford, was a classicist and their lives were rich with interesting visitors like John Betjeman, William Beveridge and Isaiah Berlin. Both her parents stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidates. \n\nAn internationally regarded historian, her best-selling books are credited with bringing the past to life, full of painstakingly researched detail and strong narrative. Her first job was in publishing, working for George Weidenfeld and then marrying the Tory MP Hugh Fraser. She wrote the first of her best selling historical biographies, Mary Queen of Scots in 1969 while the mother of six young children - \u0022the little baby enjoyed the sound of the typewriter\u0022.\n\nAlong with her husband, Nobel Laureate Harold Pinter, she has been at the centre of London\u0027s literati for well over 30 years. Her writing is still \u0022place of solitude and a solace\u0022.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: 3rd Movement of Piano Concerto No. 23 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: The complete works by Walter Scott\nLuxury: Strings and strings of false pearls.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-27T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Antonia Fraser"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00clxst","title":"John Stefanidis","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ct21r","title":"Richard Ingrams","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00cq2wb","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp003","duration":2158,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
