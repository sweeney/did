She is known as the First Lady of Football - and it\u0027s a moniker that is well earned. When she became Managing Director of Birmingham City she was just 23 years old, the club was languishing in the second division and it was in dire financial straits. Fifteen years later, and it is in the Premier League and is one of the few clubs to turn a healthy profit. \n\nAlong the way Karren has married one of her players, had two children and overcome a life-threatening brain condition. She has always, she says, relied on her enthusiasm, determination and strength of character to see her through.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Total Eclipse of the Heart by Bonnie Tyler\nBook: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\nLuxury: My own pillow.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-30T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Karren Brady"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008kkcg","title":"Victoria Wood","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008m3h1","title":"John Humphrys","first_broadcast_date":"2008-01-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b008hw2g","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp037","duration":2000,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
