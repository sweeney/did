As a singer and songwriter he has enjoyed massive global success for a quarter of a century. He\u0027s sold more than 100 million records, won two Grammy awards and notched up countless number one hits. \n\nHis ability to write, produce, and perform perfect pop songs is unquestioned. But along with the career highs, there have been lows too: he lost a long wrangle with his record company, was crippled by bereavement and for years questions about his sexuality were a matter of newspaper headlines until he was spectacularly outed a decade ago. In a rare interview, George Michael talks candidly to Kirsty Young about how he regained his emotional and professional confidence - and is now a happier and more peaceful man.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Love is a Losing Game by Amy Winehouse\nBook: Any book of short stories by Doris Lessing\nLuxury: DB9 car.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-09-30T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"George Michael"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007w97r","title":"Vladimir Jurowski","first_broadcast_date":"2007-08-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0080mb3","title":"Alan Johnson","first_broadcast_date":"2007-10-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0080014","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp04t","duration":2123,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
