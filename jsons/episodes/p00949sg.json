When he left Austria in 1936 to study at Cambridge, his fellow students dismissed his ambition to decipher the structure of the protein haemoglobin as \u0027mad\u0027. No-one had seriously attempted to map a molecule that was made up of 10,000 atoms. Twenty-two years later he was successful. It was an achievement that earned him and his colleague John Kendrew the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962 - and has since contributed to the study of blood diseases like sickle cell anaemia and Huntington\u0027s disease. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Piano Sonata No.30 in E Major by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin\nLuxury: Skis","first_broadcast_date":"2000-06-25T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dr Max Perutz"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949t2","title":"Donald Sutherland","first_broadcast_date":"2000-06-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949rq","title":"Peter Nichols","first_broadcast_date":"2000-07-02T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00949sh","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzmx","duration":2248,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
