Her skill lies partly in understanding the significance of a well cut pattern or a nicely turned seam, but also the warp and weft of a notoriously fickle industry.\n\nAt just 23, she was the toast of the catwalks with her own label selling round the world and worn by the likes of Bryan Ferry, Boy George and Mick Jagger. Dubbed \u0027the high priestess of fashion\u0027, her creative talent, however, wasn\u0027t recession-proof and her business went under in the late 80\u0027s. Given that reinvention is the lifeblood of fashion it seems she was tailor made for a new direction; collecting her O.B.E. in 2011 for services to the fashion industry, she wore a Perspex hat designed by a former pupil.\n\nShe says, \u0022we want students to take risks - like we did when we were younger. There were no set rules, there was no one to follow - you just did it yourself.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-02T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Wendy Dagworthy"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04mh755","title":"Roger Graef","first_broadcast_date":"2014-10-26T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04nvgq1","title":"Captain Eric \u0027Winkle\u0027 Brown","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-14T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04n2flm","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnybc","duration":2027,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
