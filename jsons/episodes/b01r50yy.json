The accolades began with his first novel Skellig published in 1998 when he was 47; it won the mighty \u0022Whitbread Children\u0027s\u0022 award and then many others besides.\n\nEver since, he\u0027s been acclaimed for his ability to craft complex, philosophical narratives with strikingly down to earth characterisations.\n\nHe grew up just outside Newcastle in a big, Catholic family and his childhood features heavily in his stories. \n\nHe says \u0022Each of my books has had to be written - there was something that had to come out.\u0022\n\nProducer: Alison Hughes.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-10T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Almond"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01r09sy","title":"Rankin","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-03T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01r95hg","title":"Julie Goodyear","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-17T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01r50tj","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyl4","duration":2134,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
