Her brass neck and immunity to embarrassment led to her pioneering a new brand of journalism which saw celebrities, film stars and even royalty open their hearts - and their sock drawers - to her. She rifled through Madonna\u0027s handbag and, with Ruby\u0027s encouragement, Imelda Marcos entertained the audience with a rendition of Feelings.\n\nRuby grew up in Illinois, the only child of Jewish refugees who had fled Austria in 1939. Her childhood was unhappy - and, by the time she was 18, she says she was so unconfident she feared she would never find a job without her parents\u0027 help. But she left America and came to Britain where, eventually, she was to find a place at the Royal Shakespeare Company. There, her friend and contemporary Alan Rickman persuaded her that her future lay in writing rather than acting. Her career has spanned more than 20 years but she says that while she has been enjoying the success that came her way, she has also suffered from depression and an anxiety that she should not pass on to her own children the insecurities she suffered from herself.   \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: A Day in the Life by The Beatles\nBook: The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann\nLuxury: A huge bed","first_broadcast_date":"2005-06-26T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ruby Wax"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935jm","title":"Alexander McCall Smith","first_broadcast_date":"2005-06-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935hn","title":"Paulo Coelho","first_broadcast_date":"2005-07-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935jg","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0fc","duration":2240,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
