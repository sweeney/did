For the last 30 years Mary Midgley has been one of Britain\u0027s leading moral philosophers. She has been called \u0022the most frightening philosopher in the country\u0022 as a result of her ideas and the acuity with which she defends them. Her work is chiefly concerned with the role of science in our lives; whether human nature exists, and if so, what it tells us about ourselves; the concept of wickedness; and the part that art and religion have to play in telling us about human behaviour and experience. \n\nMary was born in 1919 in Greenford, the youngest of Cannon Scrutton and his wife Lesley\u0027s two children. She was educated at Sommerville College, Oxford and after university began working as a lecturer in the philosophy department at Reading University before moving to the University of Newcastle. She married Geoffrey Midgley, also a philosopher in 1950 and they went on to have three children. Her first philosophical book Beast and Man was published in 1979 when she was 50. Since then she has continued to publish books on a diverse range of issues. Now 86, Mary continues to live in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in the home she shared with her husband Geoffrey, who died in 1997.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Fantasia on a theme by Thomas Tallis by Vaughan Williams\nBook: The Variety of Religious Experiences by William James\nLuxury: A solar hot water system","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-20T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Mary Midgley"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00934fc","title":"Renee Fleming","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-18T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009359r","title":"Sir David Frost","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009386f","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0dc","duration":2231,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
