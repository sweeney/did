With a head well-stocked with music - and ringing with Shakespeare - she is determined to survive. But she isn\u0027t proposing to be castaway for long. She\u0027s already plotting a plan of escape. In the meantime, she looks back on her long and fascinating career in the theatre, which began with advice from Ellen Terry, took her into the Gaiety Chorus (at the back) and eventually, after success in The Immortal Hour, to some of the great Shakespearian roles.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Liebestod (from Tristan and Isolde) by Richard Wagner\nLuxury: Large bottle of toilet water","first_broadcast_date":"1988-06-19T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mg1n","title":"Rt.
