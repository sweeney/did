She also has further books and a TV programme in the pipeline. \n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-08-14T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nadiya Hussain"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07mw360","title":"Michael Heath","first_broadcast_date":"2016-08-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07w5zs0","title":"Joyce DiDonato","first_broadcast_date":"2016-09-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b07nnc02","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p044b6zj","duration":2068,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
