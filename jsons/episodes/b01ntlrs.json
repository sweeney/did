She worked with James Mason, Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr and Peter Ustinov and calmed the nerves of Tennessee Williams.

Every time I go, I think, Oh, I\u0027m going to see something, I\u0027m going to be surprised!\u0022\n\nProducer: Isabel Sargent.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-16T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Blanche Marvin"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01npb0y","title":"Tidjane Thiam","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01nx32n","title":"John Lloyd","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01ntk5j","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyn7","duration":2233,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
