In 2000, he and his wife, Melinda, launched the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which has given to date over $34 billion to projects aimed at reducing health inequality around the world.\n\nBorn into a professional family - his father was a lawyer, his mother a former teacher who later became involved with volunteer work - he was introduced to the idea of \u0027giving back\u0027 at an early age. An avid reader as a child, he attended Harvard where in his sophomore year he and Paul Allen developed software for the first micro-computers. The company would go on to achieve huge success with its Windows operating system. \n\nBy 1987, Gates had become the world\u0027s youngest self-made billionaire, then worth $1.25 billion. Consistently listed as the Richest Man in the World, he stepped down as CEO of the company in 2000 although he remained as Chairman until 2014. \n\nThese days his primary focus is his philanthropy. In 2010, Gates and his friend Warren Buffett announced the Giving Pledge which aims to inspire the wealthy people of the world to give away the majority of their net worth to worthy causes.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-01-31T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Bill Gates"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06y9796","title":"Sigrid Rausing","first_broadcast_date":"2016-01-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06zqchz","title":"Professor Dame Carol Black","first_broadcast_date":"2016-02-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06z1tzw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03gv62z","duration":2137,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03gzdnq","duration":2136,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03h05jt","duration":2137,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03hh7x2","duration":2135,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
