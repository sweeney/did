Born in Glasgow, he excelled at both academia and sports making it to the University in Glasgow and then Stanford in California where he studied law but all the while dividing his time between this and his other great love - athletics. He became the fastest man in Britain holding and re-breaking the record for the 100 metres between 1967 and 1974 and competed in the 1964 Olympic and 1966 Commonwealth games.\n\nAs a lawyer he was called to the Scottish Bar in 1968 and was made QC in 1982. His political career began 30 years ago when he stood for his first parliamentary seat in 1974, fighting three more elections before winning North East Fife in 1987. He quickly became a fast-rising star and is now Deputy Leader of the party and spokesman on Foreign Affairs. He was awarded a CBE in 1987, became a privy councillor in 1999 and was knighted earlier this year in the New Year\u0027s Honours list.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner\nBook: Treasure Island \u0026 Kidnapped as one volume by Robert Louis Stevenson\nLuxury: Set of golf clubs","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-17T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rt Hon Sir Menzies Campbell MP"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009388w","title":"Anne Scott James","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936cs","title":"Jack Mapanje","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936df","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz1l","duration":2240,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
