John Cale was brought up in a strict South Wales household. His maternal grandmother insisted that Welsh was the only language to be spoken in the house even though his father spoke only English. His childhood was solitary - he was an only child and his mother encouraged him to spend hours each day practising his piano playing, and he later took up the viola. He went on to have viola lessons at the Royal Academy of Music while also studying music at Goldsmiths\u0027 Teacher Training College in London. \n\nHe was talent-spotted by Aaron Copland and awarded a musical scholarship to study in America, where he was part of the contemporary avant-garde music scene there, working with John Cage and LaMonte Young, until he met Lou Reed and the two formed Velvet Underground. Their first album, The Velvet Underground and Nico, remains their best known. Andy Warhol is credited as producer, it features Nico on vocals and the cover is the famous Warhol banana. He went on to produce some of the most influential artists of the time and has made New York his home - although Wales continues to exert some draw over him. He continues to write music and tour.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: She Belongs To Me by Bob Dylan\nBook: Repetition by Alain Robbe-Grillet\nLuxury: Express coffee machine with coffee beans","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-22T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Cale"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936vl","title":"Sacha Distel","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936sl","title":"Judith Kerr","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936tf","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz3d","duration":2114,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
