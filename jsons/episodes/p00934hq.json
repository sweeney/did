John Thaw, though a versatile stage actor, having appeared at the Royal Court and played with the Royal Shakespeare Company, is best known for the roles of Jack Reegan in the Sweeney, and, more recently, the morose but music-loving Inspector Morse. A passionate lover of classical music himself, he\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his early childhood in Lancashire, his marriage to actress Sheila Hancock and his aversion to the perils of stardom.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]  \n\nRecord: Erbarme Dich, Mein Gott (St Matthew Passion)\nBook: The Wind In The Willows by Kenneth Grahame\nLuxury: Large comfortable armchair","first_broadcast_date":"1990-10-07T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Thaw"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zxk","title":"Gary Lineker","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-30T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zwx","title":"Clive Jenkins","first_broadcast_date":"1990-10-14T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00934hr","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcnj","duration":2215,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
