According to Twiggy, \u0022she changed fashion in England singlehandedly\u0022.\n\nA newspaper advert for a \u00a33 pink gingham dress in 1963 kicked things off and by the seventies her London department store was a throbbing temple to all things skinny-fitted in plum, mulberry, green, brown and black. Romantic, mysterious, nostalgic and very profitable. But when it all turned sour with her business partners, she and her husband Fitz walked away, leaving behind the hugely popular creation that had made her name.\n\nThe fantasy and perfection of her creations were a far cry from the harsh reality of her childhood; born in Poland just before the Second World War, the air of privilege that surrounded her family was traumatically punctured when her father, a diplomat, was assassinated.\n\nShe says \u0022Now whenever I finish something I take some photographs and say \u0027goodbye\u0027. When you lose everything, you realise that the only thing you have is what\u0027s in your head.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-08T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Barbara Hulanicki"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03jyf6p","title":"Clare Balding","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03lknds","title":"Gillian Clarke","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03kphk5","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnygl","duration":2060,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
