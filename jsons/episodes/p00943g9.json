The Sin Eater, that first novel, was her reaction to the changes in the Catholic Church after Vatican Two and channelled her anger at what she saw as the excesses of the 1960s. She\u0027s a woman of apparent contradictions. She wanted to be a nun, but fell in love and became a mother of seven instead. She\u0027s deeply religious but believes in ghosts and the supernatural and although her books are often triggered by anger, they are frequently tender and full of humour. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Rorate Caeli Desuper by Monks \u0026 Choirboys or Downside Abbey\nBook: Come Hither - An Anthology by Walter de la Mare\nLuxury: A very comfortable sofa","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-29T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alice Thomas Ellis"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943h0","title":"Andrew Motion","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943fd","title":"Gavin Bryars","first_broadcast_date":"1998-04-05T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943gb","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfvz","duration":2035,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
