Inspired by Duke Ellington and encouraged by Jack Brymer, John Harle is equally at home playing jazz or classical music. He once marched with the Coldstream Guards, but left to test himself against other musicians at the Royal College of Music, gaining 100% in his final exam. As a composer he has collaborated with among others, Paul McCartney and Harrison Birtwistle, and his first opera is premiered this week.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Hunting Song by Pentangle\nBook: The Aesthetics of Music by Roger Scruton\nLuxury: Lute and strings","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-24T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Harle"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009438s","title":"Sir David Willcocks","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094375","title":"Geoffrey Smith","first_broadcast_date":"1998-06-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009437z","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfv8","duration":2154,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
