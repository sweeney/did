Often controversial, and always funny, Bleasdale\u0027s work focuses on life in Liverpool, a city he loves and whose characters people his most famous plays - Boys from the Blackstuff and GBH. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his intense love of family, his work and, as a self-confessed hypochondriac, he will be revealing some of his fears.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Shelter From The Storm by Bob Dylan\nBook: Catch 22 by Joseph Heller\nLuxury: Nail clippers","first_broadcast_date":"1991-08-25T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alan Bleasdale"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093z01","title":"Lord Shawcross","first_broadcast_date":"1991-07-07T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093yyd","title":"Maxwell Hutchinson","first_broadcast_date":"1991-09-01T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093yz6","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfh1","duration":2091,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
