Among many others, he won cases for Jeffrey Archer and Kerry Packer, and lost one for Ken Livingstone\u0027s GLC. In the 1980s he moved to the City as Chairman of the Takeover Panel and then, to his surprise, he was invited to become Chairman of the National Westminster Bank. Tipped by those who know him well to become the next Lord Chancellor if the Conservatives stay in power, he\u0027ll be discussing his past, present and future and contemplating castaway life.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Do You Hear The People Sing? by Claude-Michel Schonberg\nBook: Other Men\u0027s Flowers by Lord A P Wavell\nLuxury: Paints and canvas","first_broadcast_date":"1996-03-17T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Alexander"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nrg","title":"Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP","first_broadcast_date":"1996-03-03T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nq3","title":"Kyra Vayne","first_broadcast_date":"1996-03-24T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nr0","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdqk","duration":2228,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
