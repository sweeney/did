After graduating from Stanford and studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, he embarked on a brief political career, working for Bill Clinton\u0027s presidential campaign and on his health and social policy in the White House following his election. When Clinton\u0027s health policy reform floundered, Atul returned to Harvard to finish the medical degree he\u0027d started after Oxford.\n\nDuring his surgical residency he began writing for the online magazine Slate and he\u0027s been writing for the New Yorker since 1998. His 2009 article \u0022The Cost Conundrum\u0022 was cited by President Barack Obama during his attempt to get the healthcare reform legislation through Congress. Atul has published four books to date about the achievements, but also the limitations, of medicine.\n\nIn 2014 he presented the BBC\u0027s Reith Lectures, delivering a series of four talks titled The Future of Medicine.\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-06T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Atul Gawande"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06qg1ls","title":"Sandi Toksvig","first_broadcast_date":"2015-11-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06rl9s5","title":"Kylie Minogue","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-13T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06r0vrc","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03b07hx","duration":2096,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
