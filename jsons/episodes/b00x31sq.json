Unusually for a fighter pilot, he then went on to join Bomber Command and the famous Dambusters squadron, sinking the German battleship The Tirpitz and winning a Distinguished Flying Cross. \n\nAged 89 he returned to the skies, becoming the oldest man to fly a Lancaster bomber: \u0022Well, I got out of that aeroplane and looked at it and it and thought how did we do it?\u0022 he says. \u0022I know it was a long time ago and I was young and fit and a professional flier. But I thought about some of my friends who had been lost and it was an emotional experience.\u0022 \n\nRecord: Albinoni\u0027s Adagio in G Minor\nBook: A volume of Somerset Maugham\u0027s short stories \nLuxury: Two established vines and a tin bath to make wine \n\nProducer: Rachel Simpson.","first_broadcast_date":"2011-01-02T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Tony Iveson"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00wr4hx","title":"Sandie Shaw","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-26T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00x8f2l","title":"Gyles Brandreth","first_broadcast_date":"2011-01-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00x31sd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyyh","duration":2338,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
