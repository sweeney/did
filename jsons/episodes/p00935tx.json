Since the age of 17 Petit had been, in his own words, a \u0027wandering troubadour\u0027, making a living by doing magic in the salons of Paris. Notre Dame became the site of Petit\u0027s first illegal wirewalk, on 6th June 1971. On 7th August 1974 Philippe Petit committed \u0027the artistic crime of the century\u0027 when he put a rope between the towers of the World Trade Centre in New York and spent nearly an hour walking back and forth across it, pausing to kneel and lie down on the wire. He brought much of Manhattan, a quarter of a mile below him, to a standstill, and succeeded in pushing Richard Nixon\u0027s resignation off the front pages of the newspapers the following day. \n\nSince walking between the twin towers Petit has done wire-walks all over the world including Tokyo and Jerusalem. He has, uniquely, devised plays to be performed on the high wire and has also become artist in residence at the cathedral of St John the Divine in New York, the largest Gothic cathedral in the world.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: 1st Movement of Sonatine for Violin and Piano\nby Antonin Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\nBook: Ashley\u0027s Book of Knots by Clifford Ashley and Book of short stories\nLuxury: His mysterious object (An object found by his father that, as yet, no-one can identify)","first_broadcast_date":"2005-04-10T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Philippe Petit"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935wb","title":"Lorin Maazel","first_broadcast_date":"2005-04-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935sy","title":"Patrick Stewart","first_broadcast_date":"2005-04-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935v4","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0g5","duration":2165,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
