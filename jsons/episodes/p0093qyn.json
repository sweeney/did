She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her schooldays at Roedean, how she trained as a nurse and much later, as a doctor. When she was 29 she fell in love with a young patient dying of cancer, who bequeathed her a legacy of \u00a3500. Starting with that bequest, she raised enough money for a new kind of hospice dedicated to care for the dying. There are now 190 similar hospices throughout the country.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Symphony No 7 in A Major by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\nLuxury: Pen and paper","first_broadcast_date":"1994-01-30T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dame Cicely Saunders"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qzj","title":"Willy Russell","first_broadcast_date":"1994-01-23T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qxj","title":"Douglas Adams","first_broadcast_date":"1994-02-06T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qyp","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf2s","duration":2281,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
