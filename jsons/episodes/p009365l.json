Kim Cattrall became a household name in her forties as a result of playing man-eater, defiant singleton and PR mogul Samantha Jones in Sex and the City. She is about to star in the play Whose Life is it Anyway? in the West End of London.\n\nShe was born in Liverpool but grew up in Canada and decided to be an actress at a young age. She says a formative experience was appearing in a school play Piffle It\u0027s Only a Sniffle when she took the role of a cold germ which had to infect the other children by tickling them with a feather until they sneezed. She spent time in drama schools in Canada, Liverpool and New York and says now that her first love is theatre - and her film roles allow her to feed her theatre habit. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: My Favourite Things by John Coltrane\nBook: An English Dictionary\nLuxury: Fragrant body cream","first_broadcast_date":"2004-12-26T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Kim Cattrall"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093662","title":"Engelbert Humperdinck","first_broadcast_date":"2004-12-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093652","title":"Carlos Acosta","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009365m","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz0h","duration":2166,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
