Both her sons have reached the top flight of the game - one as Wimbledon mixed doubles champion, the other becoming the first Brit to win the men\u0027s singles in 77 years. In the moments after Andy Murray\u0027s heroic win on Centre Court last year it was to her he turned pumping his fists and roaring - as if to say \u0027we have done it\u0027.\n\nJudy\u0027s many followers on social media know how she spends her time - countless hours travelling up and down the country coaching and working to inspire children to take up the game.\n\nShe says, \u0027I\u0027ve always been competitive. I\u0027m like Andy, or maybe he\u0027s like me - I wear my heart on my sleeve. And when something is great, then yep, I am right into it\u0027.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-22T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Judy Murray"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b046j44b","title":"Raja Shehadeh","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b047w8tm","title":"Lily Allen","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0474ycr","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnycz","duration":2162,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
