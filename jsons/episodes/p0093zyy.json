Sent to the safe but lonely confines of a Swiss orphanage, she was never to see her family again. Then, after living in Israel and studying in Paris, she eventually took American citizenship. Then, 10 years ago, she emerged from obscurity to become a national celebrity. As an unemployed college lecturer in her early 50s, her appearances on radio and television, where she handed out explicit but common-sense advice on sex and its problems, brought her fame and fortune. She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her early life, her adventures in Paris and Israel and the satisfactions of her present job.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: There Was A Time by Joel Westheimer\nBook: Gone With The Wind by Margaret Mitchell\nLuxury: Large box of marrons glac\u00e9s","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-16T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dr Ruth Westheimer"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zzy","title":"Lord Charteris","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-09T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zyc","title":"Barbara Windsor","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-23T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zyz","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcnw","duration":2185,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
