Terence Stamp was one of the new group of confident, beautiful, working class young people who came to define the 1960s. He shared a flat with Michael Caine, dated the actress Julie Christie and the first supermodel Jean Shrimpton. He became an overnight success - and won an Oscar nomination - for his first film role as Billy Budd. He acted alongside Christie in Far from the Madding Crowd and found further fame with roles in The Collector and Modesty Blaise. He was driven to act after first seeing Beau Geste when he was just a small boy - the cinema offered an escape route from the monochrome world of London\u0027s East End.\n\nBut when the 1960s ended he found he was offered fewer interesting roles, his relationship with Shrimpton ended and he headed eastwards on a journey of self-discovery. Now 66, he\u0027s suave, still acting and recently married.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Impromptu No.4 in C sharp Minor by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin\nBook: Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame\nLuxury: One of his wheat-free loaves","first_broadcast_date":"2006-03-12T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Terence Stamp"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vr3","title":"Jack Higgins","first_broadcast_date":"2006-03-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vnd","title":"Daniel Barenboim","first_broadcast_date":"2006-05-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vpd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0c8","duration":2245,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
