Beneath the surface, though, he seems to be full of contradictions. He was expelled from school when he was a teenager - but went on to gain a masters degree; he has long been obsessed with Elvis Presley - but now says he feels a tingle when he goes to the opera. Although he had long enjoyed entertaining his friends, he was 30 before he realised where his future lay. \u0022I was an unemployed drunk going nowhere,\u0022 he says, \u0022And then comedy turned up. Comedy saved my life\u0022\n\nRecord: The Fall \nBook: Teach yourself French \nLuxury: A ukulele.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-13T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Frank Skinner"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00shfqr","title":"Gyorgy Pauk","first_broadcast_date":"2010-05-30T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00sqkg8","title":"Lewis Gilbert","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00sn76g","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzr2","duration":2168,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
