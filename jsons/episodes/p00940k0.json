Discovered at the tender age of 18 by Sir Laurence Olivier, and picked by him to play opposite him in Term of Trial, she went on to entertain and entrance in films like The Servant, Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines and, perhaps most famously, Ryan\u0027s Daughter. She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her professional and private life - both of which have been characterised by a fair degree of turmoil and turbulence.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Negro Spiritual by Miles\nBook: I Ching\nLuxury: Word processor","first_broadcast_date":"1990-02-04T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sarah Miles"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00940kv","title":"Lord Weidenfeld","first_broadcast_date":"1990-01-28T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00940j8","title":"Michael Tilson Thomas","first_broadcast_date":"1990-02-11T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00940k2","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcrp","duration":2299,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
