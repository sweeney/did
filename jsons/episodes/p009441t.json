He first shot into the public eye when he made what he still calls \u0022a bit of a verbal slip\u0022, and used a four-letter word on the teenage music show The Tube. These days he hosts a late night television programme, where he plays alongside such musical greats as Eric Clapton, Oasis and Tony Bennett. His own musical performance has evolved and expanded from the days when he and a mate would tour the pubs for a few pounds, a drink and a lot of adoration. In the 1970s he found success with his punk group, Squeeze. And he now fronts his own, 12-man rhythm and blues orchestra. A long way from where he began as a small boy, playing boogie woogie on his grandmother\u0027s pianola.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: (We\u0027re Gonna) Jump For Joy by Big Joe Turner\nBook: Four Books of Architecture by Andrea Palladio\nLuxury: Piano","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-05T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jools Holland"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009442z","title":"Peter O\u0027Sullevan","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-28T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094415","title":"Rose Tremain","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-12T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009441w","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfy6","duration":2034,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
