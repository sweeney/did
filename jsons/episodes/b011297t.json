He became a household name starring in BBC One\u0027s Casualty, but at the same time he was pursuing a career in writing and his award-winning plays have been staged at the National Theatre. He\u0027s just finished a stint as the artistic director of The World Festival of Black Arts in Senegal and his next posting is to the US, where he\u0027s taking over a theatre in Baltimore. Throughout his life, he says, he continues to be inspired by the joyful atmosphere he grew up in. \u0022My home was so warm, so full of life and noise. Most of my theatre I call the theatre of my front room. My memory was just this citadel to love and joy.\u0022\n\nRecord: Fight the Power\nBook: The complete works of August Wilson\nLuxury: A basic word processor\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2011-05-15T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Kwame Kwei-Armah"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b010xy3d","title":"Molly Parkin","first_broadcast_date":"2011-05-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0118cmz","title":"Debbie Harry","first_broadcast_date":"2011-05-22T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0112955","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyx7","duration":2149,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
