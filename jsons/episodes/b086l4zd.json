He\u0027s been designing elements of our everyday lives for the past six decades. Born in London in 1929, he went to Willesden art school aged fourteen and four years later he left and embarked on a remarkable career. He is still working today at 87 years old. \u0022Why would I stop? I mean, if a bloke can play the piano, you don\u0027t stop him playing it, do you?\u0022\n\nHis long career stretches from the early days of modernism to the digital age. One of his first big jobs was working for the Festival of Britain in 1951. He was co-founder of the design studio Pentagram, led a life with strong echoes of TV\u0027s \u0022Mad Men\u0022 for a while, and his work has infused the texture of the UK. His designs include the first parking meter, the Intercity 125 train, the Kenwood mixer, the Morphy Richards iron, the Wilkinson triple razor, bus shelters, the black cab, the Parker 25 pen and the Anglepoise lamp. He\u0027s also the reason we no longer get wet when we fill our cars with petrol: he designed petrol station forecourts with roofs.\n\nIn 2013 he was knighted for his services to design, and in 2016 an Intercity 125 was named Sir Kenneth Grange.\n\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-01-01T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Kenneth Grange"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b085pxy6","title":"Gareth Malone","first_broadcast_date":"2016-12-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b087pl4j","title":"Pinky Lilani","first_broadcast_date":"2017-01-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b086l4z6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p04m6952","duration":2238,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
