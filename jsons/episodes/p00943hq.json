According to mathematician Ian Stewart, it\u0027s 137-and-a-half degrees.\n\nHe calls it \u0022the golden angle\u0022, and says it can be found everywhere in nature - whether in the pattern of seeds on a sunflower head or in the spiral of a snail\u0027s shell. Mathematics, he says, has nothing to do with arithmetic and everything to do with being able to pack the luggage into the boot of the car. But for a broken collarbone which meant he stayed at home working out puzzles with his mum, he would have remained bottom of the class and never discovered how much fun maths could be. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Scarborough Fair by Simon and Garfunkel\nBook: Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter\nLuxury: Mrs Thatcher pickled in a Damien Hurst sculpture","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-15T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ian Stewart"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943jf","title":"Sir Anthony Dowell","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-08T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943h0","title":"Andrew Motion","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943hs","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfw4","duration":2108,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
