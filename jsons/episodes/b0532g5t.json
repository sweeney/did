Jonas was brought up singing in choirs, playing the piano and listening to a range of classical music. When he was seven, he was enthralled by seeing his first opera - Madam Butterfly. He studied Maths at university, but soon changed to music and quickly started getting professional singing work.\n\nSince then he has taken on many of the great roles for tenors, at opera houses around the world - Don Carlo, Don Jos\u00e9 (Carmen), Alfredo (La Traviata), and Cavaradossi (Tosca). He is also known as a singer of \u0027Lieder\u0027 \u0026 renowned not only for the beauty of his voice but for his musical range.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-02-22T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jonas Kaufmann"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0520t2t","title":"Mark Rylance","first_broadcast_date":"2015-02-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b053sbvb","title":"Julia Samuel","first_broadcast_date":"2015-03-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0532g1g","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny8f","duration":2194,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
