Described as the most active and influential conductor in Britain today, he has been the musical director at Glyndebourne for the past six years, and this autumn takes over as Principal Conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. \n\nVladimir\u0027s roots however lie in Russia, where he was one of the last generation to experience the Communist regime. The two-room apartment in Moscow that he shared with his parents, siblings and grandmothers, was always full of music; his father was a conductor. He says he \u0022grew up in the wings of the theatre\u0022, and he knew from a very early age that his life too would be dedicated to music. However, he resisted following in his father\u0027s footsteps until he was seventeen, when he heard Mahler\u0027s music for the first time. \n\nAfter that, he says, there was no turning back. He changed as a person, physically he says, when he picked up the baton, and went on to make his conducting debut at the tender age of 23. He has been constantly in demand around the world ever since, but manages to combine this international career with being a husband and father.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Variations 29 \u0026 30 by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Complete Works by Aleksandr Pushkin\nLuxury: A piano.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-08-19T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Vladimir Jurowski"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007vvsq","title":"Felix Dennis","first_broadcast_date":"2007-08-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008006s","title":"George Michael","first_broadcast_date":"2007-09-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b007w93t","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp04x","duration":2335,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
