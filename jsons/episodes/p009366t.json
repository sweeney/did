For the past 12 years he has been half of the award-winning double act, The Long Johns, with John Bird, that have brought a sharper political edge to Bremner, Bird and Fortune. As a result of the act, they have been named the Best Opposition by The Oldie Magazine and are Bafta award winners. It is a return to the forefront of political satire for John Fortune - he had joined Peter Cook in setting up The Establishment Club in the 1960s and had taken the review to America to widespread acclaim and returned to Britain to write for, among others, BBC Three and Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Piano Sonata No 30 in E Major by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The Leopard (In Italian \u0026 English) by Giuseppe di Lampedusa\nLuxury: A rug made by the Baluch people from Afghanistan","first_broadcast_date":"2004-12-12T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Fortune"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009367v","title":"Sir Bobby Robson","first_broadcast_date":"2004-12-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093662","title":"Engelbert Humperdinck","first_broadcast_date":"2004-12-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009366y","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz0q","duration":2188,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
