Due to retire in November 1997, Peter O\u0027Sullevan calculates that he has commentated on some 14,000 races. \n\nAfter calling his last Grand National earlier this year he perhaps breathed a sigh of relief, because even after 50 broadcasts he admits to still finding the responsibility nerve-wracking. Horses have always been his life. He owns them, bets on them, writes about them and campaigns for their welfare, with the same enthusiasm that he had as a young boy riding with his grandparents\u0027 groom, Truelove.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Piano Concerto 5 in E Flat Major by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: Ends and Means by Aldous Huxley\nLuxury: Bottle Of Calvados","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-28T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Peter O\u0027Sullevan"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009443p","title":"Mike Leigh OBE","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-21T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009441t","title":"Jools Holland","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-05T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094432","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfy8","duration":2220,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
