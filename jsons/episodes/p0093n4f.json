Jennifer Saunders began \u0022doing funny things with props\u0022 in the early 1980s. With her stage partner Dawn French, she toured the clubs and comedy venues making people laugh with acts like The Menopause Sisters. As part of the Comic Strip performers, she burst onto our TV screens as one of the famous, if rather manic, five.\n\nNow through her characters Edina and Patsy, she has created a comedy classic. But as she tells Sue Lawley, Absolutely Fabulous came about because, having taken a year off from French and Saunders, the phone was ominously silent, and she had absolutely nothing else to do.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: I Didn\u0027t Have The Nerve To Say No by Blondie\nBook: Traveller\u0027s Prelude by Freya Stark\nLuxury: Tribute Heads By Elisabeth Frink","first_broadcast_date":"1996-12-22T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jennifer Saunders"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n4m","title":"Ian Dury","first_broadcast_date":"1996-12-15T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n47","title":"Martin Amis","first_broadcast_date":"1996-12-29T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093n4g","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdlh","duration":1935,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
