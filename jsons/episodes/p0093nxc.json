Chili Bouchier will be talking to Sue Lawley about some of the perils of making silent movies and her transition into the talkies with hugely successful films like Carnival and Gypsy. She\u0027ll also be describing the ups and downs of a personal life which has been as vivid as her many films - encompassing two disastrous marriages with men who betrayed her, marriage proposals from Howard Hughes and breaking her Hollywood contract with Warner Brothers which meant she was blackballed and unable to make another film.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise by Acker Bilk\nBook: In Tune With The Infinite: Fullness of Peace Power by Ralph Waldo Trine\nLuxury: Make-up kit","first_broadcast_date":"1996-01-21T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Chili Bouchier"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ny8","title":"Jimmy McGovern","first_broadcast_date":"1996-01-14T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nwl","title":"Julian Barnes","first_broadcast_date":"1996-01-28T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nxd","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdrs","duration":2205,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
