When he was born, in 1938, his father Richard was already a national institution. Richard recorded reports from bombers flying over Germany, went to Belsen at the end of the war and, of course, commentated on the funeral of King George VI and subsequent coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. In Desert Island Discs, David tells Kirsty how his father had tried to steer him away from journalism. But he believes that it is a job that is addictive and so it was perhaps inevitable that he would become part of the fifth generation of Dimblebys to pursue a career in the media.\n\nHe is best known for the big state events - he has anchored the BBC\u0027s general election coverage since 1979 and commentated during the funerals of both Princess Diana and the Queen Mother - throughout them all, he says, his method is not to think of the audience of millions, but instead to imagine himself sitting on a sofa, next to just one viewer, saying as little as he needs to in order to explain what is happening.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Song that You\u0027d Like by Kate Dimbleby Band\nBook: Collected essays by Michel de Montaigne\nLuxury: A collection of drawing books, pencils and varnish.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-02-24T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Dimbleby"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008yn16","title":"Martin Evans","first_broadcast_date":"2008-02-17T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0091xz9","title":"Michael Ball","first_broadcast_date":"2008-03-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0090fvt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp02b","duration":2231,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
