Born and bred in the East End of London, he took the fashion business by storm in the 1960s - discovering, photographing and often marrying some of the world\u0027s most beautiful women. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about success in the 1960s, the first time he saw Jean Shrimpton and his desire to carry on working, like his hero Picasso, until he\u0027s 90.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Dance Of The Earth (Rite Of Spring) by Igor Stravinsky\nBook: Vioces of Silence by Malraux\nLuxury: Nelson\u0027s Column","first_broadcast_date":"1991-09-29T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Bailey"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093yvt","title":"Klaus Tennstedt","first_broadcast_date":"1991-09-22T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093yt5","title":"Imran Khan","first_broadcast_date":"1991-10-06T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093yv4","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfgl","duration":2222,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
