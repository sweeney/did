She began writing as a child soon after her father left home. It became a kind of therapy for her and she explains it\u0027s something she still turns to, especially in moments of crisis. Recognised for her ability to get right inside the minds of her characters, she offers the reader a view of the world through their eyes. In her book Sacred Country, we become a little girl who believes she\u0027s really a boy. In Restoration, we live the life of a 17th-century man. As a writer, she wants her work to feel dangerous, and so after extensive research she likes to forget it; keeping some facts and making others up. It\u0027s like playing a game with the reader, she says, a challenge to guess which is fact and which is merely fiction.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Dance Me To The End Of Love by Leonard Cohen\nBook: A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking\nLuxury: Word processor","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-12T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rose Tremain"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009441t","title":"Jools Holland","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-05T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943zz","title":"Richard Rodney Bennett","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-19T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094416","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfy3","duration":2160,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
