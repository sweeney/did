He has won armfuls of awards for his work - most recently an Emmy for his portrayal of Robert Maxwell - but he is best known for the character he has been associated with for 20 years, Hercule Poirot.\n\nHis approach to his work is meticulous and he says he has to inhabit each role he takes on. In this illuminating interview he recalls how, early in his career, a psychologist showed him how to shed his character at the end of each performance otherwise, he found, the edges between his own life and those of the person he was playing became blurred.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: When I Fall In Love by Nat King Cole\nBook: Magnum Magnum by Brigitte Lardinois\nLuxury: His clarinet and an unlimited supply of reeds.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-08T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Suchet"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00h4d2l","title":"Thomas Quasthoff","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00hhfc8","title":"Professor Dame Kay Davies","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00h9vc6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzy2","duration":2208,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
