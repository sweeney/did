On Desert Island Discs this week, the writer Rumer Godden describes how her rich life in India (under the Raj) and in Britain has influenced her novels.\n\nShe says she can\u0027t remember a time when she didn\u0027t write. Now in her late 80s, and after publishing more than 50 books, including Black Narcissus and The River, she\u0027s just added another to her list. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Kinderscenen Traumerei by Robert Schumann\nBook: The Atlantic book of British and American Poetry by Edith Sitwell\nLuxury: A widow\u0027s cruse filled with whisky","first_broadcast_date":"1996-10-13T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rumer Godden"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n87","title":"Lewis Wolpert","first_broadcast_date":"1996-10-06T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n6w","title":"Jackie Charlton","first_broadcast_date":"1996-10-20T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093n7j","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdmw","duration":2471,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
