The name behind a dazzling array of hit musicals like Half A Sixpence, Charlie Girl, Sweet Charity and Barnum, his failures have been nearly as spectacular as his successes - his production of Ziegfeld crashed two years ago, making a loss of more than two million pounds, and this year his new musical with Petula Clark had to close early. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the highs and lows of show business life and about the stars he has looked after, such as Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich and Ginger Rogers, to name but a few.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Piano Concerto in A Minor - Opening by Robert Schumann\nBook: Great Murder Trials of 20th Century by Sir David Napley\nLuxury: Large bag of sugar","first_broadcast_date":"1990-06-17T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Harold Fielding"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009404y","title":"Maeve Binchy","first_broadcast_date":"1990-06-10T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009403p","title":"George Carman QC","first_broadcast_date":"1990-06-24T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009404f","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcpp","duration":2258,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
