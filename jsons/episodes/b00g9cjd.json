What many of us would struggle to do over three life-times he has managed in one - as a teenager, nursing a broken heart and determined to prove himself, he joined the French Foreign Legion. Fighting in the Algerian war, he risked his life many times over; combat was at close quarters and was very bloody. \n\nNext, he set his sights on business - he ran some of the most well-known companies in South East Asia and was one of Chris Patten\u0027s key allies during the handover of Hong Kong. Then, in his 60s and looking for a new challenge, he chanced upon the idea of polar adventure, and went on to become the oldest person to walk unsupported to the South Pole. But after all this, his greatest achievement, he says, is his marriage. Perhaps it\u0027s no surprise that his wife of 43 years, Jennifer, is the first woman to have flown a helicopter solo around the world. These days their three children try to curb their enthusiasm for dangerous pursuits. But, Simon snorts, the couple simply say: \u0022we\u0027re not listening.\u0022\n\nThis programme contains descriptions that some listeners may find disturbing.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: O Soave Fanciulla (Oh beautiful maiden) by Giacomo Puccini\nBook: Cautionary Tales by Hilaire Belloc\nLuxury: Lots of paper, pencil and pencil sharpener.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-04T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Simon Murray"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00g42m2","title":"Baroness Haleh Afshar","first_broadcast_date":"2008-12-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ghq25","title":"Ruth Padel","first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00g9cgl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzyh","duration":2152,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
