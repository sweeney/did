His life defies easy description. In America in the 1960s, he was part of Andy Warhol\u0027s circle of friends. He got to know Wallis Simpson and the Duke of Windsor and met Cyd Charisse and President Kennedy; and after all that, he became a cowboy. When he returned to Britain he brought the sleek style of the States with him. When he is designing a room, he says, first he lets the room speak to him, then his client - then he gets the last word on how it should look.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: You\u0027re Just In Love from Call Me Madam by Ethel Merman \u0026 Dick Haymes\nBook: A Legacy  by Sybille Bedford\nLuxury: A large 18th-century picture.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-08-02T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nicky Haslam"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ltn9m","title":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00lxvkz","title":"Dame Joan Bakewell","first_broadcast_date":"2009-08-09T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00lr0tq","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzw3","duration":2091,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
