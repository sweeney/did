A proponent of what he calls \u0027upside down management\u0027, his employees, all of whom are called \u0027colleagues\u0027, enjoy an unusual degree of autonomy in the running of the individual shops and 10% of the company\u0027s employees have spent time in prison. \n\nMarried to his late wife Alex for over 47 years, together they fostered 90 children. He has written several books on leadership and pens a weekly business advice column.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-03-27T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Timpson"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07418qw","title":"Gloria Steinem","first_broadcast_date":"2016-03-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b079m78n","title":"Tom Hanks","first_broadcast_date":"2016-05-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b074vw58","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03nwqcg","duration":2133,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
