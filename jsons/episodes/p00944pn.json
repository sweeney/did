His food is the culinary equivalent of haute couture, but in the 1980s Nico Ladenis was known as much for his temper tantrums as his truffle sauce. His refusal to offer his customers salt and pepper, and his insistence as to how they should eat their meal, caught the headlines more frequently than his fine cooking. But, as he tells Sue Lawley, these days he has come out of the kitchen and become a cooler and much calmer man.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Onward Christian Soldiers by Sullivan\/Baring-Gould\nBook: Beau Jeste by P C Wren\nLuxury: Cantona\u0027s Manchester United football shirt","first_broadcast_date":"1997-02-23T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nico Ladenis"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944qq","title":"Mary Benson","first_broadcast_date":"1997-02-16T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944nr","title":"Dr Susan Greenfield","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-02T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00944pv","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppg0m","duration":2179,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
