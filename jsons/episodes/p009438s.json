For some 38 years he trained the Bach Choir - the most popular amateur choir in Britain. His retirement in 1998 he describes as \u0022\u0022like the end of an affair\u0022\u0022. As the Director of Music at Kings College Cambridge, he tranformed small boys with dirty knees into an angelic choir. His gift is a mix of natural talent and experience. At the age of eight he joined the choir school at Westminster Abbey, where he was conducted by Elgar. Later, he worked closely with Vaughan Williams whose humility and humour he remembers, produced some masterful performances.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Oh Sacred Head by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Book on astronomy\nLuxury: King\u0027s College Chapel","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-17T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir David Willcocks"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009439n","title":"Antony Gormley","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009437w","title":"John Harle","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009438t","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfvb","duration":2325,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
