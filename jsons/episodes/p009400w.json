Since then, he has spent much of his time at sea visiting many islands, deserted or otherwise, and recently he undertook a voyage using only those navigational instruments available to sailors 500 years ago. Very much the adventurous master mariner, he\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the perils and pleasures of life at sea.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs].\n\nFavourite track: Land Of Hope And Glory by Edward Elgar\/Benson\nBook: Books identifying birds and fish\nLuxury: Video recorder and tapes of Queen Mother\u0027s parade","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-02T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Robin Knox-Johnston"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009401l","title":"Jean Rook","first_broadcast_date":"1990-07-15T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zzy","title":"Lord Charteris","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-09T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009400x","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcp5","duration":2315,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
