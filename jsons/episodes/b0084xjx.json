Actor, quizmaster, cabaret performer, straight man, panel show host and fully-qualified marine mechanical engineer to boot; spanning more than 60 years his professional credits defy classification and flout convention. Yet it\u0027s not just the duration of his showbiz career that\u0027s exceptional but the fact that he made it on stage at all. From well-to-do parents, his family had a \u0022neurotic dread of the dissolute thespian life\u0022 and did their utmost to thwart his budding ambition. \n\nSickly, dyslexic and with an intermittent stutter he wasn\u0027t an obvious star in the making, but as he himself puts it - \u0022The joy of performing is that you overcome the insecurity of your nature and are reassured by the reaction of the audience\u0022. Nicholas Parsons reflects on his role as the comic straight man over the years, firstly for Arthur Haynes in the 1950s and 1960s, and then as the consummate host of the long-running radio quiz Just a Minute.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Children Will Listen by Barbra Streisand\nBook: Oxford Anthology of English Poetry by John Wain\nLuxury: Portable radio with an endless supply of batteries.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-04T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nicholas Parsons"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0084b4l","title":"Lord Joffe","first_broadcast_date":"2007-10-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0088vmz","title":"Jung Chang","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-16T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0084x6k","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp047","duration":2234,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
