Professor Alison Richard is Cambridge University\u0027s first full-time female Vice-Chancellor. An anthropologist by training, the role of Vice-Chancellor makes her the principal academic and administrative officer of one of Britain\u0027s oldest universities, at the head of some 18,000 undergraduates and assets of more than a billion pounds. \n\nShe has been in post for just over a year and, for her, it is a return to the university where she studied as an undergraduate. She accepted the post after spending 30 years in America at Yale University - the last eight there as Provost. But much of her professional life has been based not in the ivory towers of academe, but in remote jungles and foothills working as an anthropologist studying the Madagascan lemur. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The end of Richard Strauss\u0027s Der Rosenkavalier\n by Richard Strauss\nBook: Journals by Captain Cook\nLuxury: Solar-powered shower","first_broadcast_date":"2005-03-06T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alison Richard"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093612","title":"Geoffrey Palmer","first_broadcast_date":"2005-02-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935z5","title":"Stephen Poliakoff","first_broadcast_date":"2005-03-13T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093605","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0gh","duration":2294,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
