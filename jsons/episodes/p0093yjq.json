Lovers of British situation comedy knew him a long time ago as a familiar supporting figure in It Ain\u0027t Half Hot, Mum and Are You Being Served?, but for most people he has only one part: that of the French cafe owner Rene Artois in \u0027Allo \u0027Allo. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his childhood years in Yorkshire, his love of comedy and natural talent for it, and the loyalty of his audience through good and bad times.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Hallelujah Chorus by George Frideric Handel\nBook: This Is Your Life by Gorden Kaye\nLuxury: A clock given to him for turning on the Oxford lights","first_broadcast_date":"1991-12-22T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gorden Kaye"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093yl0","title":"Sue Townsend","first_broadcast_date":"1991-12-08T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093yj0","title":"Steven Berkoff","first_broadcast_date":"1992-01-12T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093yjr","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppffj","duration":2170,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
