He opened his first pub, Martin\u0027s Free House, in 1979 in North London. Now the chain employs 37,000 people, in 891 pubs of which 54 are hotels. Travelling from his home in Devon, Tim visits at least ten of them a week taking detailed \u0027call notes\u0027 on the staff, the beer, the quality of the food and even the cutlery. \n\nIn 2016 he became one of the most high-profile UK business people arguing in favour in leaving the EU. He printed half a million beer mats for his pubs, making the case for Brexit. \n\nHis success in the pub industry might be in the genes. His father, initially an aerobatic pilot, later worked for Guinness, which took the family around the globe and Tim spent his childhood in both New Zealand and Northern Ireland. He trained for the law but instead chose the career of a publican. \n\nPresenter: Kirsty Young\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-12-03T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Tim Martin"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b09gc4p7","title":"Naomi Klein","first_broadcast_date":"2017-11-26T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b09hp7cl","title":"Kelsey Grammer","first_broadcast_date":"2017-12-10T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b09h0bh8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"b09jnvgy","duration":1800,"types":["Shortened"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p05pnxhg","duration":2061,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
