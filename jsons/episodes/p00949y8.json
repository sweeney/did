He was only six when he decided he wanted to be an actor. And now after seventy years in show business he is still touring the world with his one man show. It was the war which made him a star and the films he made then eventually led to Hollywood. There he made friends with Laurence Olivier, Rex Harrison and Noel Coward, to whom he says he owes a great debt.\n\nHe won an Oscar for his performance in Ryan\u0027s Daughter, but one of his favourite films remains Ice Cold in Alex. In it, he got to kiss Sylvia Sims, a scene which was later cut by the censor for showing too much of her cleavage and which had to be reshot with only three buttons undone instead of four. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: All the Things You Are by Chick Henderson \nBook: The Warden by Anthony Trollope\nLuxury: His piano","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-07T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir John Mills"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949yp","title":"Sir Peter Bonfield","first_broadcast_date":"2000-04-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949xj","title":"Kathleen Turner","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00949y9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnznh","duration":2014,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
