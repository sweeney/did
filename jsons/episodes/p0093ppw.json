He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about how he uses his voice as an instrument, producing the unusually high falsetto sound which characterises counter-tenor parts. He\u0027ll also be describing his association with Benjamin Britten, who offered him his first part - as Oberon in Britten\u0027s opera A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream. Britten went on to write parts for him in Death in Venice and The Journey of the Magi, all of which have contributed to his highly successful career.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Symphony No 2 in D, Op 73 by Johannes Brahms\nBook: Rebecca by Dame Daphne Du Maurier\nLuxury: Faberg\u00e9 egg","first_broadcast_date":"1995-04-09T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"James Bowman"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pqk","title":"Nina Bawden","first_broadcast_date":"1995-04-02T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pp9","title":"Hugh Grant","first_broadcast_date":"1995-04-16T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093ppy","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdx3","duration":2181,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
