To the record-buying public, he\u0027s a pop star of durable quality; to the theatregoers who like musicals, he\u0027s an actor-singer, and he\u0027s a popular music composer too. His name is David Essex, and, in conversation with Sue Lawley, you can hear about his life, his work and his enthusiasms in Desert Island Discs.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: March No 1 in D Major (Pomp and Circumstance) by Edward Elgar\nBook: The Guinness Book of Records\nLuxury: A set of cricket equipment","first_broadcast_date":"1988-07-10T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Essex"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mfz5","title":"David Owen","first_broadcast_date":"1988-07-03T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mfxs","title":"Dame Edna Everage","first_broadcast_date":"1988-07-17T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mfyf","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppd0v","duration":2007,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
