He studied at the London School of Economics and married the daughter of a manufacturer - the owner of a small electrical company. By the age of 34, he was its Managing Director. Today that company is a huge institution - GEC - which its Managing Director Lord Weinstock has steered safely through the choppy waters of nine changes of government and six Prime Ministers. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his life and work and about his passionate love of music.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Requiem - Recordare by Giuseppe Verdi\nBook: If This Be A Man by Primo Levi\nLuxury: Photograph album - family, friends, colleagues","first_broadcast_date":"1993-05-23T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Weinstock"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093wxz","title":"Eva Burrows","first_broadcast_date":"1993-05-16T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ww4","title":"Kaye Webb","first_broadcast_date":"1993-05-30T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093wx3","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf6f","duration":2256,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
