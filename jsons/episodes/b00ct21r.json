Former editor and a founder of the satirical magazine Private Eye, he\u0027s one of the godfathers of contemporary British satire. Pseud\u0027s Corner, Dear Bill, and Colemanballs all originated with him at the helm. Now editor of The Oldie, he\u0027s still taking part in regular ideas meetings at Private Eye and says he wouldn\u0027t know what to do if he stopped working.\n\nFrom a privileged and well-connected background he seemed an unlikely outsider, yet he\u0027s spent a lifetime pulling the rug from under the feet of the great and the good. It\u0027s often proved a risky route, bringing him into conflict with army recruiting sergeants, cabinet ministers and billionaire industrialists alike. One of four boys, his favourite childhood memories are of accompanying his mother on the piano while she played the violin. He met Willie Rushton at school when they worked on the school magazine and at Oxford he met Paul Foot and other Private Eye regulars contributing to more magazines - Parson\u0027s Pleasure and Mesopotamia.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Gloria from Mass in B Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Teach yourself piano tuning \nLuxury: Grand piano.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-03T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Richard Ingrams"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00cq31h","title":"Antonia Fraser","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00cx1ds","title":"AC Grayling","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00ct1zh","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzzz","duration":2196,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
