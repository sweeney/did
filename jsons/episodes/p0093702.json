His film credits include My Beautiful Launderette, When Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, Dangerous Liaisons, High Fidelity and, most recently, Dirty Pretty Things. He is one of Britain\u0027s most talented and well-known directors, achieving success with his Hollywood work as much as for low budget, British productions. \n\nHe was born in Leicester in 1941 and, despite studying law at Cambridge, was not tempted to train to be a lawyer, and instead sought employment at the ground-breaking Royal Court Theatre in London. He left the Royal Court in the 1960s to work with the highly acclaimed Czech film-maker Karel Reisz. His television work has included many collaborations with Alan Bennett, but it wasn\u0027t until the 1980s that he became famous with a film that was initially destined for television, which was so successful it was released to cinemas. It was \u0027My Beautiful Launderette\u0027 - starring a then unknown Daniel Day Lewis and examining the racial and sexual tensions of Thatcher\u0027s Britain.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: I\u0027m Against It by Grouch Marx\nBook: The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon\nLuxury: A painting by his wife","first_broadcast_date":"2004-01-18T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Stephen Frears"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093710","title":"Jimmy Tarbuck","first_broadcast_date":"2004-01-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936z1","title":"Paul Dacre","first_broadcast_date":"2004-01-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093704","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz3w","duration":2681,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
