He made his name with The Naked Ape first published in 1967 in which he persuasively argued the case for viewing man as a \u0027risen ape\u0027 rather than a \u0027fallen angel\u0027. To him, humans should be observed like any other beast in the animal kingdom. The book has sold more than 12 million copies and has been translated into 23 languages. Dozens more books have followed including The Human Zoo, which compared the social problems of humans living in cities to the behaviour of stressed animals in a zoo. \n\nHe\u0027s also a successful artist - once holding the directorship of the Institute of Contemporary Arts - and he\u0027s exhibited his work at galleries around the world.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Imagine by Alex Parks\nBook: Tales from Arabia: One Thousand and One Nights by Richard Burton\nLuxury: Snorkel","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-03T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Desmond Morris"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936fb","title":"Virginia McKenna","first_broadcast_date":"2004-09-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009388w","title":"Anne Scott James","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009389l","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz1t","duration":2080,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
