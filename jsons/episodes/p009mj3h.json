He had wanted to be a printer and live on a kibbutz. His success as Tevye in the musical The Fiddler on the Roof, both in London and in the film, brought him international acclaim and he has gone on to make many more films, but he still returns regularly to Israel to work.\n\nIn conversation with Roy Plomley, he talks about his career and chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Those Were The Nights by Esther Ofarim With Orchestra\nBook: Great Treasury of Western Thought by Mortimer J Adler\nLuxury: Artist\u0027s kit","first_broadcast_date":"1983-10-15T18:25:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Topol"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mj48","title":"Mollie Harris","first_broadcast_date":"1983-10-08T18:25:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mj2w","title":"Linda Esther Gray","first_broadcast_date":"1983-10-22T18:25:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mj3n","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppbzv","duration":2079,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
