Before that, he ran the Royal Shakespeare Company and he was responsible for setting up their London base at the Aldwych. In spite of this heavy administrative responsibility, he has always found time to produce many plays and operas, including this year\u0027s Ring Cycle at Bayreuth. In conversation with Roy Plomley, he talks about his amazingly active life and chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Man That Got Away by Judy Garland\nBook: The New Grove Dictionary of Music \u0026 Musicians\nLuxury: Photograph of children","first_broadcast_date":"1983-11-12T18:25:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Peter Hall"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mj1f","title":"Shirley MacLaine","first_broadcast_date":"1983-11-05T18:25:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mj03","title":"Sir Hugh Greene","first_broadcast_date":"1983-11-19T18:25:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mj0w","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppbyp","duration":2037,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
