He has acted in 104 films, including such classics as MASH, Don\u0027t Look Now and JFK. Tall and lanky as a child, he was called \u0027Goofus\u0027 or \u0027Dumbo\u0027 because of his big ears. However, it was those ears that caught the attention of the director of The Dirty Dozen and thus his film career was launched. \n\nNow appearing on the British stage for the first time in 36 years, he chooses eight records to take to the mythical desert island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Horn Concerto No.4. in E Flat Major 495 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: Distant Mirror  by Barbara Tuckman\nLuxury: Case of really good vintage wine","first_broadcast_date":"2000-06-18T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Donald Sutherland"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949tr","title":"Clive James","first_broadcast_date":"2000-06-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949sg","title":"Dr Max Perutz","first_broadcast_date":"2000-06-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00949t7","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzn0","duration":2109,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
