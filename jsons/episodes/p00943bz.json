From a sickly boy, living in the one room he and his family shared, he became a successful businessman and millionaire - and all because of an inspirational piece of music. Today on the site of an old carpet factory in Halifax, he\u0027s brought together his two loves - business and the arts - to form an environment in which plastic-bag manufacturers and building societies draw inspiration from the painters and sculptors who work alongside. At the age of 68 he has also realised his ambition to be a professional pianist.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Piano Trio in B Major by Franz Schubert\nBook: The collected works by William Blake\nLuxury: Piano","first_broadcast_date":"1998-04-26T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Ernest Hall"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943cr","title":"Sir Terry Frost","first_broadcast_date":"1998-04-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943bd","title":"Susan Blackmore","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943c1","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfvl","duration":2256,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
