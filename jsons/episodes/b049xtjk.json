If you\u0027ve watched fuzzy little polar bear cubs frolic in the frozen wilderness or slick killer whales eerily circling their prey, the spellbinding footage is his. David Attenborough, a long- time collaborator describes his work, simply, as \u0022extraordinary\u0022.\n\nA trained biologist he first made a living diving into the icy rivers of Scotland searching among the mussel-beds for pearls; a useful early lesson in patience and coping with the cold. His subsequent dedication to a working life in the wilderness has bagged him a slew of Baftas and Emmys but there\u0027s also been an emotional toll - he\u0027s coped with periods of depression and is twice divorced.\n\nHe says, \u0022Big animals are my passion. I particularly love working with large mammals because they\u0027re intelligent and you can develop a relationship with them\u0022\n\nAnd he\u0027s at his happiest at -18 degrees centigrade!","first_broadcast_date":"2014-07-20T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Doug Allan"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0495llz","title":"Anne Reid","first_broadcast_date":"2014-07-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04bmdf7","title":"Dame Wendy Hall","first_broadcast_date":"2014-07-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b049xp37","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnych","duration":2198,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
