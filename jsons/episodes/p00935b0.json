He is one of the most creative and influential broadcasters of his generation. He has been hailed as the saviour of more than one radio station and made a name for himself on television too - first of all on The Big Breakfast, but also with his own formats, including Don\u0027t Forget Your Toothbrush and TFI Friday. He\u0027s won a clutch of awards and, by taking over Virgin radio, made himself a millionaire many times over. But he also gained a reputation for being brash and bullying; he walked out on more than one job and his drinking binges were splashed across the tabloids.\n\nSince those days he\u0027s married and divorced, lived in America and, more recently, pursued a more peaceful existence - keeping chickens and growing vegetables at his cottage in the English countryside.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Here, There and Everywhere by The Beatles\nBook: Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: A pair of swimming goggles with prescription lenses","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-06T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Chris Evans"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935b6","title":"Boris Johnson MP","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00934fc","title":"Renee Fleming","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-18T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935b1","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0dh","duration":2104,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
