Throughout the seventies he also hosted the true music-fans\u0027 must see show, The Old Grey Whistle Test. His beard and tank top were almost as legendary as some of the guests - The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and John Lennon were among the line up. However with the arrival of punk things got personal.\n\nThe closest his family ever got to showbiz was when his dad, a policeman, clambered on stage to arrest the singer PJ Proby when his trousers split. Young Bob did follow his dad into the force but music and above all else radio were his obsession.\n\nMuch like his recording heroes, his own life has something of the rock n\u0027 roll vibe - three wives, eight children, a spell of bankruptcy and coping with prostate cancer. Yet through it all his skill, knowledge and love of broadcasting has always endured.\n\nHe says, \u0022I\u0027m a music anorak, a fan who got lucky ... from the moment I bought my first record aged 11, I couldn\u0027t wait to share music with others.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-02T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Bob Harris"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03p8wdc","title":"Sir Ben Ainslie","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-26T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03tr7hy","title":"Dame Elish Angiolini","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03sr7dp","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyfp","duration":1985,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
