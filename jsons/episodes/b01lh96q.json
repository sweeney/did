Now in her mid-fifties and a cross-bench peer, she\u0027s spent her adult life campaigning for equality for disabled people and was one of the leading voices behind the Disability Discrimination Act of 1995. \n\nShe recalls: \u0022I found myself sitting in the middle of Westminster Bridge bringing the traffic to a standstill. The police didn\u0027t know what to do with us - whether to pat us on the head or, you know, put handcuffs on us. They were quite confused.\u0022\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-08-05T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Baroness Campbell"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01l5pll","title":"Mary Berry","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01lsts1","title":"Craig Brown","first_broadcast_date":"2012-08-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01lh8xr","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyp5","duration":2229,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
