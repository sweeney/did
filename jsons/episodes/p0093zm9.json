Arnold Goodman started off his professional life as a bright young North London solicitor, and, through a capacity for skilful negotiation and judicious advice, became the confidante of some of the most eminent political figures of post-war Britain. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his experience of Prime Ministers and politics, as well as his passion for opera, which, as a director of the Royal Opera House, he has been able to indulge to the full.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: O Namenlose Freude by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: Who\u0027s Who\nLuxury: An enormous box of chocolate ginger","first_broadcast_date":"1991-01-06T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Goodman"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zn8","title":"Keith Floyd","first_broadcast_date":"1990-12-30T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zlq","title":"Adelaide Hall","first_broadcast_date":"1991-01-13T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zmb","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfm3","duration":2269,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
