He first became noticed in the early 1980s in television programmes such as The Comic Strip, The Young Ones and Saturday Night Live. Since then he\u0027s become an international star - one of his most recent films, Nuns on the Run, played successfully on both sides of the Atlantic. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about, amongst other things, his love of Scotland, his passion for vintage cars and his fear of live performances.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Letter From America by The Proclaimers\nBook: Lady In The Lake by Raymond Chandler\nLuxury: Pencil and paper","first_broadcast_date":"1992-02-09T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Robbie Coltrane"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093yf6","title":"J G Ballard","first_broadcast_date":"1992-02-02T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ych","title":"Sir Roger Bannister","first_broadcast_date":"1992-02-16T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093yd8","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfdz","duration":2230,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
