To his surprise, he became a sex symbol, was dubbed the \u0027male Ursula Andress\u0027 and was voted Britain\u0027s Most Popular Actor in a BBC poll. He went on to send up the role on the big screen - as the ironically-named Mark Darcy, the brooding boyfriend of Bridget Jones.\n\nHe always knew he wanted to act - from the moment when, as a five year old boy, he took on the role of Jack Frost at a school panto. He studied at the Drama Centre in London\u0027s Chalk Farm - where one of his teachers, Christopher Fettes, said he was by nature a poet and compared his acting to that of Paul Schofield. Married to an Italian woman and with two young sons, he now divides his time between life in London and in Italy.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Opening of the Kyrie from Mass in C Minor by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: Stories by Woody Allen\nLuxury: His guitar","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-04T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Colin Firth"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009359r","title":"Sir David Frost","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009359c","title":"David Hope","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009359l","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0d7","duration":2131,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
