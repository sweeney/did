He was a child growing up in Africa when he was first drawn to philosophy because it offered, he says, a licence to study \u0027the whole horizon of human knowledge and endeavour\u0027. It\u0027s a study he has undertaken seriously and practically - he has tried his hand at composing music, writing plays and painting - not because he wanted to master those skills, but to acquire a greater understanding of the talents of musicians, writers and artists. \n\nHe lives in London with his wife and young daughter and teaches at Birkbeck College, but he remains evangelical about taking philosophy out of the ivory towers and into people\u0027s homes - so that it is a practical tool to help people live lives that are engaging and fulfilling. He is motivated, he says, by the knowledge that the human life-span is fewer than a thousand months - and with our time so limited, it is incumbent upon us all to use it thoughtfully and well. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The adagio from the Violin Concerto in D Major by Johannes Brahms\nBook: The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil\nLuxury: A good piano.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-10T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"AC Grayling"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ct21r","title":"Richard Ingrams","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00czqsp","title":"Ruthie Henshall","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00cwzcz","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzzx","duration":2283,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
