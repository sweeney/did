Indeed being relevant and useful is how Julie Bentley has spent her entire working life. From her early efforts at an HIV charity to running the Family Planning Association she says her passion lies with helping young people develop confidence and direction.\n\nNever a Brownie or Girl Guide herself, she was brought up in what she describes as \u0022a happy working class family in Essex\u0022 and it took her a little while to find her own self assurance and sense of purpose. A painfully shy child, who was bullied at primary school, she later went on to become Head Girl, but left school with very few qualifications. In her 30s she used a bequest from her mother to fund her Master\u0027s degree.\n\nShe says of the Girl Guides, \u0022It is not about itchy brown uniforms and sewing and baking. It is a modern, contemporary, vibrant organisation.\u0022\n\nProducer: Christine Pawlowsky.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-07T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Julie Bentley"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04stgz0","title":"Damian Lewis","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04v2lv7","title":"Sarah Millican","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-14T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04tcjh9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny9s","duration":2029,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
