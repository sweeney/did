He was born in the East End of London in 1960. As a child, his great passion was musicals and stage shows - rather than ballet. Despite his later success, he showed no interest in dance until the age of 20 when he enrolled at the Laban Centre for Movement and Dance in London.\n \nHe\u0027s built his reputation on his unconventional interpretations of classical ballets such as Nutcracker which he reworked from being a cosy Christmas setting to a grim Victorian Orphanage. Swan Lake was similarly changed with the traditional tutu-clad ballerinas being replaced by dozens of bare-chested male dancers with wings, and he transformed Carmen into Car Man about a bisexual male drifter set in a small American town. He was awarded an OBE in 2001.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Night and Day by Ella Fitzgerald\nBook: Diaries by Kenneth Williams\nLuxury: Spotted Dick with Lyon\u0027s syrup","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-19T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Matthew Bourne"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936b8","title":"Ann Leslie","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009369h","title":"Clive Stafford Smith","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093885","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz15","duration":2166,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
