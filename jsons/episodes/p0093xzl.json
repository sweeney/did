Recently appointed the Lord Chief Justice of England, he\u0027ll be discussing the public\u0027s perception of the English legal system, following the recent series of miscarriages of justice; and also, his plans to open up areas of the law and to rid the system of some of its more antiquated trappings, such as wigs and robes. He\u0027ll also be talking to Sue Lawley about how, as an accomplished musician, he might well have become a professional pianist rather than the Lord Chief Justice.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Symphony No 41 in C K 551 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: Piano","first_broadcast_date":"1992-05-24T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Chief Justice Taylor"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093y0w","title":"Michael Grade","first_broadcast_date":"1992-05-17T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093xyx","title":"Prunella Scales","first_broadcast_date":"1992-05-31T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093xzm","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfch","duration":2275,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
