He hoped to become an author and began work on The Field magazine as a messenger boy, but then ran away to Paris at seventeen to write a novel. This venture failed and he ended up begging on the streets before returning to Britain and the Guildford School of Drama and Dance.\n\nHis first film role was as a delivery boy in Joan Collins\u0027 steamy film The Bitch. He\u0027s featured in numerous stage, TV, and radio dramas including the acclaimed Men\u0027s Room in 1991 and, more recently, in State of Play, where he played a newspaper editor. His career has been described by some critics as a slow burn rather than a beacon, although he\u0027s now widely recognised as achieving the acclaim he deserves. In February he won Best Supporting Actor at the Baftas for his role as Billy Mack, a washed up singer in the film Love Actually.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Winter by The Rolling Stones\nBook: 1st edition of 49 Stories  by Ernest Hemingway\nLuxury: Boxed set of blues harps (harmonicas) and instruction book","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-14T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Bill Nighy"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938gm","title":"Sir Gulam Noon","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936ql","title":"Ralph Kohn","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936rq","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz36","duration":2021,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
