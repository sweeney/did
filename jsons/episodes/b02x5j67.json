She thinks designers cut clothes too small, refuses to let superstars have photo and copy approval and when she was first appointed editor, she\u0027d never even been on a fashion shoot. During her tenure Vogue\u0027s circulation has increased.\n\nHer first job as editor was with the men\u0027s magazine GQ and she\u0027s had spells at Tatler, the Sunday Telegraph and writing a weekly column for the Daily Mail.\n\nShe says, \u0022Vogue is not my personal taste, really. I think of it more as a kind of newspaper, reporting on what\u0027s out there.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-16T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alexandra Shulman"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b02lrl30","title":"Conrad Anker","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b02y0wn6","title":"Hugh Laurie","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b02x5gtd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyk6","duration":2069,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
