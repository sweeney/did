Alongside Mark Elder and Peter Jonas at the ENO, he tried to make opera more attractive to a wider audience. The opera stage, he says, shouldn\u0027t be treated like a mantle shelf filled with fragile objects. It\u0027s a versatile and robust art form which needn\u0027t be stuck in the past. So he staged Carmen in an automobile graveyard, with a pink Cadillac and a giant billboard, while his Hansel and Gretel was set in a 1950s housing project.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: String Quartet No 2 \u0027Intimate Letters\u0027 by Leos Jan\u00e1\u010dek\nBook: Anthology: The English Year by Geoffrey Grigson\nLuxury: Croquet lawn","first_broadcast_date":"1998-02-22T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Pountney"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943lz","title":"Richard Noble","first_broadcast_date":"1998-02-15T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943kc","title":"Archie Norman MP","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-01T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943l8","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfwg","duration":2262,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
