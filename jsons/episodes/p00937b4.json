Originally from suburban Maidenhead, his obsession with football, as chronicled in the autobiographical Fever Pitch, began after his parents divorced and his dad struggled to find a suitable way to pass the weekend. The decision to visit Arsenal had lasting repercussions with Hornby becoming a fanatical supporter. \n\nHis next work, High Fidelity, featured Horrnby\u0027s other great passion - pop music. It became a bible for all men who\u0027ve ever catalogued their record collections in alphabetical order or agonised over their own Desert Island Discs choices. His next book, About a Boy, resulted in a bidding war with Robert De Niro\u0027s film company buying the rights for \u00a32 million. How to Be Good, which followed, changed tack with a female narrator and is in part autobiographical reflecting the pros and cons of a virtuous life - questions he\u0027s had to ask following the birth of his son Danny who suffers from severe autism. He\u0027s since set up the TreeHouse Fund, a national charity for autism which has a school in London.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Kitty\u0027s Back by Bruce Springsteen\nBook: Barnaby Rudge by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: An mp3 player (iPod)","first_broadcast_date":"2003-09-28T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nick Hornby"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938ln","title":"Bryn Terfel","first_broadcast_date":"2003-09-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009379c","title":"Nigella Lawson","first_broadcast_date":"2003-10-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00937b6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz5h","duration":2070,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
