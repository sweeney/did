Bill Gates is officially a fan, the man who sends him hate mail related to his work on irregular verbs is not. It would seem that whenever he publishes yet another best-selling book controversy is never far behind - his recent contention that we live in an \u0022unusually peaceful time\u0022 drew opprobrium from many quarters.\n\nBorn and brought up in Montreal his parents encouraged vigorous debate around the dinner table - indeed it was his mother\u0027s interest in the psychology of language and linguistics that sparked his own.\n\n\nHe says \u0022I appreciate what my parents did for me beyond words. Not in making me what I am, but in my view of what\u0027s important in life, what I think about and cherish.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-30T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Steven Pinker"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b02y0wn6","title":"Hugh Laurie","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b036jc4b","title":"Jane Somerville","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0366xj8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyk0","duration":2089,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
