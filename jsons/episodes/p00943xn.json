He grew up on the Isle of Wight in a close-knit family of Italian descent, and says that he has never felt truly English. It is not surprising therefore that his most successful film explores questions of identity and nationality. That film, The English Patient, won nine Oscars. It is, he admits, unashamedly moving, since for him the purpose of fiction is to \u0022exercise the emotional muscle\u0022. Music, too, plays an important part in his life. He listens to music as he writes and the structure of many of his plays and film scripts are influenced by it. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Mache Dich, Mein Herze, Rein by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Collected Piano Works by Bach\nLuxury: Piano","first_broadcast_date":"1997-11-09T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Anthony Minghella"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943yg","title":"John Julius Norwich","first_broadcast_date":"1997-11-02T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943wx","title":"Thelma Holt","first_broadcast_date":"1997-11-23T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943xp","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfxs","duration":2178,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
