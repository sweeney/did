For 10 years, he has been the BBC\u0027s expert on the Middle East - always authoritative and insightful, his analysis is based on first-hand knowledge of the region - after years spent studying Arabic and living and working in the Middle East. \n\nBut in June last year the reporter became the news. He and his cameraman were attacked by gunmen while they filmed in Saudi Arabia. His colleague was killed, he was shot six times and left for dead. Incredibly, he survived - though with devastating injuries. Now he is paraplegic - he has some feeling and movement in his legs above the knee but none below. He uses a wheelchair for most of the day though remains determined to walk some of the time using callipers and a walking frame. Nearly a year after the attack he returned to work - continuing to analyse the terrorist threat and trying to explain the circumstances behind it - he is, he says, busier than ever.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Third movement of Concerto No 2 by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: A Passage to India by E.M Forster\nLuxury: A solar-powered buggy","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-02T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Frank Gardner"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935f7","title":"Julian Clary","first_broadcast_date":"2005-09-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935cm","title":"Michael Winner","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935dl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0dw","duration":2110,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
