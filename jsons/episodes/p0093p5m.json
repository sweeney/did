In 1950, her first novel The Beautiful Visit was published. Now, some 45 years later and after many other books, she has just completed the concluding book of The Cazalet Chronicles. She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the problems of combining writing and marriage; she abandoned her three marriages - her first husband, being the naturalist Peter Scott, and her last, the writer Kingsley Amis; and she\u0027ll be ruminating on the nature of love and who might experience it. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Requiem Dies Irae by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: All the sonatas by Scarlatti\nLuxury: Piano","first_broadcast_date":"1995-10-29T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Elizabeth Jane Howard"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093p6k","title":"Don Black","first_broadcast_date":"1995-10-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093p4t","title":"Rt Hon Gillian Shephard MP","first_broadcast_date":"1995-11-05T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093p5q","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdt5","duration":2465,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
