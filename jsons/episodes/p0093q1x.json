He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the hard road to recognition in this country - which he describes as being \u0027enemy territory\u0027 for painters. At 62, he has now achieved fame, fortune and to him a somewhat irksome knighthood. He\u0027ll be describing his problematic schoolboy years, his total commitment to art and what he considers to be the impact of his own work.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Youkali by Teresa Stratas\nBook: Journal De Eugene Delacroix by Eugene Delacroix\nLuxury: Mayonnaise - permanent supply","first_broadcast_date":"1994-11-27T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Howard Hodgkin"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093q2q","title":"Glenys Kinnock","first_broadcast_date":"1994-11-20T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093q14","title":"Margaret Forster","first_broadcast_date":"1994-12-04T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093q21","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdyx","duration":2247,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
