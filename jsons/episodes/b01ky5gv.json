Talent-spotted in his teens, he went on to spend two years touring the world with Peter Brook\u0027s Mahabharata. A keen collaborator, he\u0027s worked with everyone from prima ballerina Sylvie Guillem to disco queen Kylie Minogue. \n\nHe says he was a shy boy and dance allowed him to communicate properly for the first time: \u0022It was like being allowed to speak - and people taking notice of that and that\u0027s another problem because then you want people\u0027s attention all the time, so, every dinner party we went to, I said, Mum, are they going to ask me to dance? It became an addiction.\u0022 \n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-22T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Akram Khan"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01kr7q1","title":"Simon McBurney","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01l5pll","title":"Mary Berry","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01ky580","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnypc","duration":2214,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
