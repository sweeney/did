His career has seen him go from enfant terrible and champion of new music, writing pieces such as Worldes Blis and Eight Songs for a Mad King, to Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Master of the Queen\u0027s Music. Peter Maxwell Davies was born in Salford, near Manchester, in 1934. Whilst studying at Manchester University and the Royal Manchester College of Music he formed the key friendships which were to influence his musical career - with Harrison Birtwhistle, Elgar Howarth, Alexander Goehr and John Ogdon. It was during the 60s that Peter composed some of his most influential works - including often cacophonous, expressionist pieces like Vesalii Icones, St. Thomas Wake and Worldes Blis. Music-theatre pieces like Eight Songs were groundbreaking in their use of drama, as well as music. He is fascinated by the mathematical structures and patterns that exist in nature - and tries to replicate them in his music. For more than 30 years he has lived on and been inspired by the Isles of Orkney where, he says, the sounds that surround him creep into his music almost without him knowing it. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Victimae Paschali Laudes by The Benedictine Monks of Silos\nBook: Sanskrit dictionary\nAlternative to Bible: Bhagavad-Gita\nLuxury: Copper plate engravings of  Durer\u0027s Passion","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-30T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Peter Maxwell Davies"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093635","title":"Dr Jonathan Miller","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009361r","title":"David Starkey","first_broadcast_date":"2005-02-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009362f","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0gp","duration":2325,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
