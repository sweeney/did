Born during the First World War, he was brought up in the company of some of the greatest artists and writers of the day.\n\nIn World War II, he escaped his bombed-out ship clinging to a life raft with Lord Mountbatten.\n\nAt the Bar he played a central role in many of the seismic trials of the day - among them defending the novel Lady Chatterley\u0027s Lover against obscenity charges and Christine Keeler in the Profumo Affair trial. His brilliance in cross-examination inspired John Mortimer\u0027s creation of the character Rumpole of The Bailey.\n\nHe enjoyed two long marriages - his first to the actress Peggy Ashcroft, his second, for 40 years, to June Osborn, and he spent 23 years as an active member of The House of Lords.\n\nHe says, \u0022I had the luck to live when the world of the Establishment was being dismantled. The whole of one\u0027s career was to do with what was going on in society.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-10-20T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jeremy Hutchinson"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03cd94y","title":"Chris Packham","first_broadcast_date":"2013-10-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03f87bb","title":"Professor Tanya Byron","first_broadcast_date":"2013-10-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03ddsj7","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyh7","duration":2212,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
