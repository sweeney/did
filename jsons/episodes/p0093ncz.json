He first came to fame with the Habitat store which introduced British shoppers to consumer delights like the chicken brick and the duvet. Now considered one of the country\u0027s most successful restaurateurs - he currently owns seven restaurants and is involved in designing another 17 - he\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his original foray into the restaurant world. His first venture was called The Soup Kitchen - and, misled by its name, attracted all the local tramps on its opening night. \n\nHe\u0027ll also be describing how Picasso bought one of the first chairs he designed. Finally, he\u0027ll be talking about how, after a somewhat tumultuous personal life, he now feels he has achieved some sort of equanimity.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Keith Jarrett\u0027s Koln Concert Part One by Keith Jarrett\nBook: History of the World by H G Wells\nLuxury: An endless supply of A4 paper and 4B pencils","first_broadcast_date":"1996-09-01T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Terence Conran"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ndt","title":"Anita Lasker-Wallfisch","first_broadcast_date":"1996-08-25T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nc4","title":"Professor Colin Blakemore","first_broadcast_date":"1996-09-08T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nd2","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdnh","duration":2221,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
