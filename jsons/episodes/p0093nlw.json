She was born in Japan, but, when she was 12, her family moved to Vienna, where she fully immersed herself in the music that she has now become famous for playing - Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and in particular, Mozart. Her aim is to be always faithful to the composer whose work she is trying to interpret.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Cello Suite No 1 in G Major by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: A title, in Russian and English, by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: Piano","first_broadcast_date":"1996-04-28T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Mitsuko Uchida"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nmp","title":"Hanif Kureishi","first_broadcast_date":"1996-04-21T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nl9","title":"Pauline Quirke","first_broadcast_date":"1996-05-05T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nlz","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdpl","duration":2322,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
