As he tells Roy Plomley, other than a period as Director of Music at Morley College, he has allowed very little to distract him from composition. His output includes four symphonies, four operas, four string quartets and several concertos.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Vespro Della Beata Vergine by Claudio Monteverdi\nBook: Blank pages\nLuxury: Egg timer","first_broadcast_date":"1985-01-05T18:25:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Michael Tippett"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mgwj","title":"Ray Cooney","first_broadcast_date":"1984-12-15T18:25:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mnb0","title":"Tom Stoppard","first_broadcast_date":"1985-01-12T18:25:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mnbq","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppbp7","duration":2190,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
