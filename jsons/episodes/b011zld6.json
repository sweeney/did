Born in London\u0027s east end, as a kid he was a barrow-boy, selling fruit and veg on his grandfather\u0027s stall. He went on to work on the docks as a welder. But come Saturday night he would don his best threads and head for the Embassy ballroom in Welling. \n\nHe was in his sixties when he found international fame and it was, he says, perfect timing. \u0022If it had happened when I was thirty, I\u0027d have been one these people that would be seen rolling out of nightclubs drunk, with a couple of dolly-birds on my arm. The pilot was on my sixtieth birthday and I think it was the perfect age because I was sensible by then, my feet were planted firmly on the ground.\u0022\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2011-06-19T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Len Goodman"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b011tw7l","title":"Andrea Levy","first_broadcast_date":"2011-06-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0122p93","title":"Dame Harriet Walter","first_broadcast_date":"2011-06-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b011zl71","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnywq","duration":2168,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
