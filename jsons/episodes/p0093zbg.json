Although her public life is one as comedienne, television presenter, star of a sit-com series, singer and glamorous pantomime performer, Marti Caine\u0027s private life is one that is very different. Her father died when she was seven, she was taken into care before she was 10, her first marriage broke up, and then, about four years ago, she was diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the lymph glands. She talks about the way in which she\u0027s coped with all these things and the way her sense of humour helped her through.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Thanksong by Dave Grusin\nBook: A DIY manual\nLuxury: Do-it-yourself solar-powered kit","first_broadcast_date":"1991-03-24T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Marti Caine"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zcb","title":"Sir Trevor Holdsworth","first_broadcast_date":"1991-03-17T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093z9q","title":"Naomi Mitchison","first_broadcast_date":"1991-04-07T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zbk","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfkh","duration":2135,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
