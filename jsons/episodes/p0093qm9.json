Sir John Wilson lost his sight at the age of 12 in an accident in his school chemistry laboratory. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about how, undaunted, he went on to win a scholarship to Oxford, and then, at the age of 30, mortgaged his home and set up the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind. Since then, he has travelled an average of 50,000 miles a year, helping to restore or save the sight of millions of people the world over. Last year he was awarded the Albert Schweizer International Award for Medicine. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Mass in B Minor: The Sanctus by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: A chess strategy book (in braille)\nLuxury: A sonic probe","first_broadcast_date":"1994-05-08T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir John Wilson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qnj","title":"Garrison Keillor","first_broadcast_date":"1994-05-01T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qlf","title":"Kate Adie","first_broadcast_date":"1994-05-15T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qmc","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf1g","duration":2275,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
