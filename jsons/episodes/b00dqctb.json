He is hailed as the opera director of his generation and is in such great demand that he\u0027s booked up for the next five years. Opera appealed to him when he was still a boy, offering him a means of escape from his lonely and unhappy childhood in Glasgow. He immersed himself in it so much that now, he says, it\u0027s pretty well impossible for him to come to an opera fresh, somewhere it will already be in his memory. He says: \u0022I didn\u0027t choose to work in opera - opera chose me. But I think opera made the right choice.\u0022\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Von Ewiger Liebe by Johannes Brahms\nBook: Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray\nAlternative to Bible: Bhagavad Gita\nLuxury: Well stocked bar \u0026 fridge.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-10-05T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David McVicar"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00dm5mm","title":"Miriam Margolyes","first_broadcast_date":"2008-09-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00dtw41","title":"Sanjeev Bhaskar","first_broadcast_date":"2008-10-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00dqcpk","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzzn","duration":2073,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
