Hardly a front runner when the job vacancy came up he said that it would be \u0022a joke\u0022 and \u0022perfectly absurd\u0022 if he were appointed.\n\nHis faith has brought him high office but when he \u0027found God\u0027 at university, it gave him something a good deal more significant: a sense of much needed comfort after an often turbulent and uncertain childhood. Although his mother\u0027s side of the family provided stability, his father was an alcoholic and his childhood was punctuated by his parents\u0027 early divorce and significant money worries - one particular Christmas was spent hungrily staring out of the window as his father lay in bed all day.\n\nHe says, \u0022When the church is working it is the most mind-bogglingly, amazingly, extraordinarily beautiful community on earth. It heals, it transforms, it loves, and it changes society.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-21T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"The Most Reverend Justin Welby"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04v2lv7","title":"Sarah Millican","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-14T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04vjz0b","title":"Ray Winstone","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04vd5f8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny9l","duration":2337,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
