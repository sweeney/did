He is a scientist who comes from a long line of academics - his father was an astronomer who recruited him at an early age to help build a homemade aeroplane, the \u0027flying flea\u0027, but luckily the project was abandoned before its fatal design fault was discovered. Professor Gregory has gone on since then to invent robots, hearing aids, special telescopes for astronauts, and to set up his famous foundation - the Exploratory in Bristol - which is visited by thousands of people every year.\n\nHe\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his passion for investigation and invention and about his mission to lift the fog of ignorance which surrounds so many people when it comes to scientific matters.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Piano Sonata No 30 in E Opus 109 by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: An astronomy book by Patrick Moore\nLuxury: Astronomical telescope","first_broadcast_date":"1993-04-04T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Richard Gregory"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093x3l","title":"David Croft","first_broadcast_date":"1993-03-14T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093x1r","title":"Lord Oaksey","first_broadcast_date":"1993-04-11T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093x2t","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf7f","duration":2263,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
