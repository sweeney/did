His ceramics are on display in many of the world\u0027s major museums. They\u0027re delicate pots in shades of white and cream, informed he says by a great deal of thinking about literature. \n\nHis written work has also won him several awards; his book \u0022The Hare With Amber Eyes\u0022 traces the rich and dramatic story of his family\u0027s Russian Jewish heritage and the diaspora in Odessa, Paris, Vienna, and Tokyo.\n\nHe says, \u0022I make pots and I write. I\u0027m not one of those people who by mistake became a potter or by mistake is a writer - they are both completely entwined.\u0022\n\nProducer: Isabel Sargent.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-25T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Edmund de Waal"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01nx32n","title":"John Lloyd","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01p314n","title":"Dustin Hoffman","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01p03x9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnymy","duration":2195,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
