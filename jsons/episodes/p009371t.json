Her drive and ambition were recognised at school and college - her brother claims her nickname was \u0027Fast Lane Foxy\u0027. After studying modern and classical history at Oxford University she became a management consultant at a small company and met Brent Hoberman - who had the idea for lastminute.com. Initially, Lane Fox rubbished the idea, but eventually Brent convinced her and she joined him, appropriately enough, at the last minute. The pair launched lastminute.com in 1998 - it started out as an online bucket shop - selling the holidays that small travel agents couldn\u0027t get rid of - and branched out into entertainment and gifts. On March 14th, 2000, days before the markets peaked, lastminute.com was floated on the stock exchange - and over the following weeks prices collapsed. Martha Lane Fox became the face, the figurehead and eventually the fall-girl for the dot-com bubble. In November 2003, after lastminute.com announced a profit for the first time, Lane Fox announced she was resigning as managing director.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Get Happy by Judy Garland\nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: A karaoke machine","first_broadcast_date":"2004-01-04T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Martha Lane Fox"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938hj","title":"Paul O\u0027Grady","first_broadcast_date":"2003-12-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093710","title":"Jimmy Tarbuck","first_broadcast_date":"2004-01-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009371v","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz45","duration":2105,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
