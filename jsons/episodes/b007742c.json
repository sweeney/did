He has written some of the most controversial and successful television programmes of the past decade. Shameless, Clocking Off and State of Play all flowed from his pen and have won him bags of awards. \n\nBut he was driven to write as a response to the chaotic and traumatic childhood he\u0027d suffered. One of eight children, both parents had left the family home by the time he was 11, leaving his older sister to bring them up. They had a near-feral existence, and lived, says Paul, like rats. At 15 he attempted suicide and ended up in a psychiatric ward. After that, without wanting to or really being aware it was happening, he wrote as a way of letting out the rage he felt inside him. \n\nHe was quickly able to turn this writing into short stories, radio plays and film scripts and to sell them. Now he is credited with making television the \u0027new National Theatre\u0027. But it\u0027s not his greatest achievement - he is proudest of his successful marriage to Saskia, his wife of eighteen years, and of their two children.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Town Called Malice by The Jam\nBook: Complete Works by Arthur Miller\nLuxury: Writing pad and pencils.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-02-11T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Paul Abbott"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00773ry","title":"Neil Tennant","first_broadcast_date":"2007-02-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00774c4","title":"Grayson Perry","first_broadcast_date":"2007-02-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b006vfvt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp077","duration":2020,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
