A Cambridge professor and fellow of the Royal Society, she has dedicated much of her life to studying everyday objects like plastic, food or plants. Her enthusiasm is so strong that, at her daughter\u0027s eleventh birthday party, she couldn\u0027t resist describing the structure of melting ice-cream - it was a rare case of misjudging her audience. \n\nBy her own admission she is a workaholic - but she also champions the cause of women who want to become scientists and have families too. Her great triumph was to marry a supportive husband and after that, she says, the trick is learning how to cut corners: there are no \u0027dainty dinner parties\u0027 at her home, and she makes sure her clothes are machine washable and easy-iron.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Dies Irae (from Requiem) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: The Lymond Novels by Dorothy Dunnett\nLuxury: A bat.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-22T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Athene Donald"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00j26xw","title":"Baaba Maal","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00jc3q3","title":"Sebastian Faulks","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00j5jzz","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzxh","duration":2208,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
