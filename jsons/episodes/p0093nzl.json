She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the night 11 years ago when the IRA detonated a huge bomb at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where she was staying with her husband for the Tory Party Conference. Since that dreadful night, she has been severely paralysed, and she\u0027ll be describing the effect on her life: the dreams she has in which she no longer has to use a wheelchair, the new friends she\u0027s made and the old ones who turned out not to be such good friends in adversity and how her previous experience of mental illness - in the form of severe depression - compares with her current physical incapacity.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Nocturne by Evert Taube\nBook: Hillier\u0027s Dictionary of Plants by Hillier\nLuxury: An endless team of Man Fridays","first_broadcast_date":"1995-12-31T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lady Margaret Tebbit"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093p0m","title":"Petula Clark","first_broadcast_date":"1995-12-24T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nyw","title":"Christopher Hampton","first_broadcast_date":"1996-01-07T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nzr","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppds4","duration":2217,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
