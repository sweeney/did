Mitchell has won two Bafta awards and, as a sitcom actor, sketch show writer and humorous columnist, has never been in greater demand.\n\nBut as a child, Mitchell was sure he wasn\u0027t funny and it was only when he was at university, he says, that he learnt how to have fun. It is now just the rest of his life that Mitchell needs to address - beginning, he says, by tidying up his flat and then, maybe, even getting a girlfriend.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Rainbow Connection by Jim Henson\nBook: Decline and Fall by Evelyn Waugh\nLuxury: DVDs of sitcoms and DVD player.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-19T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Mitchell"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ljhmb","title":"Prof Hugh Pennington","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-12T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ltn9m","title":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00ln14q","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzw9","duration":2129,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
