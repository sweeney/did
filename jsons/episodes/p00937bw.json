Born in Upper Armley, Leeds, by the age of 16 Barbara had graduated from the typing pool and was a cub reporter in the newsroom of the Yorkshire Evening Post. By twenty she was Fashion Editor of Woman\u0027s Own in London.\n\nIn 1976, after a number of failed attempts, she sold her first novel to a publisher on the basis of a ten-page outline. That book A Woman of Substance, has gone on to sell in the region of 20 million copies. The heroine, Emma Harte, inspired such a following that she and her dynasty were the subjects of two further books and despite Emma being \u0027killed off\u0027 in the second, Taylor Bradford has resurrected her for a \u0027lost years\u0027 prequel this summer. Emma\u0027s Secret will be her 19th novel, with 10 of them made into TV films.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Vissi d\u0027Arte by Giacomo Puccini\nBook: David Copperfield by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: Bag of eye make-up, especially mascara","first_broadcast_date":"2003-07-06T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Barbara Taylor Bradford"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937cv","title":"Daniel Libeskind","first_broadcast_date":"2003-06-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938ln","title":"Bryn Terfel","first_broadcast_date":"2003-09-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00937by","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz5m","duration":2195,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
