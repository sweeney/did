Enlightening and entertaining the sofa-bound masses is only one strand on his hand whittled bow: he\u0027s also trained elite troops for The British Army and in 2010 he was called on by police to help them track the fugitive killer, Raoul Moat.\n\nIt was survival skills of a different type he needed when he lost his first wife Rachel to cancer: he met his second wife Ruth at a book signing and they share not just a love of each other, but also of the great outdoors.\n\nHe says of the wild: \u0022I can see nature; I feel it intuitively and I can understand what can\u0027t be written.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-05T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ray Mears"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03mckqs","title":"Ant and Dec","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03pdfp7","title":"Nicola Benedetti","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-12T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03nrp9k","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyg3","duration":2056,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
