Since the age of 29, muscular dystrophy has left him in a wheelchair. Nevertheless, now 70, he can look back on a full and vivid life encompassing a 24,000 mile trip across South America and expeditions across the Sahara and the Saudi Arabian desert. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his travels, his close relationship with the Macmillan family, his work as a writer and restaurant critic and also his belief that disability need be no bar to a happy and fulfilled life.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: String Quintet In C Major 163 by Franz Schubert\nBook: Essays by Michel de Montaigne\nLuxury: The cellar from Trinity College, Cambridge","first_broadcast_date":"1996-06-16T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Quentin Crewe"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ngb","title":"Peggy Mount","first_broadcast_date":"1996-06-09T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093979","title":"Andr\u00e9 Previn","first_broadcast_date":"1996-08-18T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nft","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdnw","duration":2166,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
