Born in Hamburg 91 years ago, he enjoyed a brilliant early career working with many famous musicians in Germany and Russia. But he\u0027ll be telling Sue Lawley how, as a Jew, he was forced to flee the Nazis and take refuge in Britain. Sadly, the musical establishment of his adopted homeland found his music old-fashioned and neglected him until the 1980s, when his music started to be rediscovered and widely appreciated.\n\nNow experiencing a highly-successful revival all over Europe and America, as well as having his work recorded and performed at the Proms, he is greatly enjoying his new-found recognition.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Goldberg Varations BWV 988 - No 26 by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Joseph and His Brothers by Thomas Mann\nLuxury: Vanity case including metal mirror and shaving kit","first_broadcast_date":"1994-11-13T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Berthold Goldschmidt"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093q49","title":"Archbishop Desmond Tutu","first_broadcast_date":"1994-11-06T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093q2q","title":"Glenys Kinnock","first_broadcast_date":"1994-11-20T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093q3k","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdz3","duration":2322,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
