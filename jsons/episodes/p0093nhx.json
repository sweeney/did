Renowned for his theatrical flair - with a string of successes such as Sleuth, The Rocky Horror Show, O, Calcutta and A Chorus Line - he\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the downside of show business as well as the euphoria of the successful first night. He\u0027ll also be describing his cosmopolitan but miserable childhood. Sent away to school in Switzerland alone and just seven years old because of chronic asthma, his early years were often lonely and confusing.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Coming In From The Cold by Bob Marley\nBook: A title by Marcel Proust\nLuxury: Bicycle","first_broadcast_date":"1996-05-26T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Michael White"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093njn","title":"Janet Holmes \u00e0 Court","first_broadcast_date":"1996-05-19T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nh2","title":"Gerry Robinson","first_broadcast_date":"1996-06-02T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nj1","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdp7","duration":2128,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
