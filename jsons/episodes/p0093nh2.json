From there, he worked his way up the corporate ladder of several large companies until 10 years ago he organised and led a management buy-out of Compass - part of Grand Metropolitan.\n\nNow extremely rich in his own right, he\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the controversy he then attracted. Known as \u0027The Caterer\u0027 because of his business background, he went on to acquire London Weekend Television and controversially to take over the Forte Group. He\u0027ll be discussing his early ambitions to be a priest, his days at a seminary, the high-achieving nature of his family and how he coped with the stress of the Granada takeover of the Forte Group. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Norma Casta Diva by Vincenzo Bellini\nBook: The History of the World by J M Roberts\nLuxury: Painting kit (easel, oils, brushes)","first_broadcast_date":"1996-06-02T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gerry Robinson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nhx","title":"Michael White","first_broadcast_date":"1996-05-26T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ngb","title":"Peggy Mount","first_broadcast_date":"1996-06-09T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nh6","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdp4","duration":2173,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
