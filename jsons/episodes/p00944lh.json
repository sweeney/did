She\u0027s also coloured Ringo Starr\u0027s library cranberry red, and suggested tasselled tie-backs for Rod Stewart. Nina Campbell is one of Britain\u0027s top interior designers and a devotee of the English country house style, although, as she admits to Sue Lawley this week, she never goes near the country - it\u0027s too wet and windy.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Design For Living by Flanders \u0026 Swann\nBook: A photograph album\nLuxury: A bed","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-16T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nina Campbell"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944ms","title":"Redmond O\u0027Hanlon","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-09T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944km","title":"Peter Blake","first_broadcast_date":"1997-03-23T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00944lj","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppg08","duration":2082,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
