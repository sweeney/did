Josephine Cox is one of Britain\u0027s most popular authors. She became an overnight publishing sensation at the relatively late age of 43 and has written 34 books which have sold 15 million copies worldwide. Now, her publishers print \u0027bestseller\u0027 on the cover of each new work, they\u0027re so confident of its success. \n\nBut it was by no means a straightforward route to fame and fortune. She was born in Blackburn during World War II and grew up in dire poverty. As a child, she used to charge her school friends a penny for her to tell them a story, she and her siblings slept six to a bed, and they used to drink water out of jam-jars. One of her teachers recognised her talents and prophesied her future success as a writer. But it was only decades later when, convalescing after an illness, she had the time to pick up a pen and write. Her first book was accepted immediately and she has been writing two books a year ever since. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Imagine by John Lennon\nBook: \u0022A book which is in my head about my brother\u0022\nLuxury: Photo album of my family","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-08T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Josephine Cox"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935ql","title":"Katharine Whitehorn","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-01T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935np","title":"Imelda Staunton","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935px","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0fw","duration":2010,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
