He began writing when he realised that poetry didn\u0027t have to be about daffodils in a far off English field but could reflect the world around him; from the sheep and cows on the family farm, to the wallabies in the outback. His most powerful subject though, is his own depression which has dogged him for more than 50 years. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: La Valse a Mille Temps by Jacques Brel\nBook: Blank, lined book\nLuxury: Marble four-poster bed","first_broadcast_date":"1998-08-16T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Les Murray"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009430p","title":"David Hempleman Adams","first_broadcast_date":"1998-08-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00942z7","title":"Ralph Koltai","first_broadcast_date":"1998-08-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00942zv","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppft0","duration":2296,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
