His father\u0027s influence was tremendous and Paul Dacre says he can\u0027t remember a time when he didn\u0027t want to be a journalist and, in truth, an editor. He studied English at Leeds University but confesses to missing lectures in Anglo Saxon in favour of working on the student newspaper. Paul Dacre edited the student paper while Jack Straw was president of the students\u0027 union and, after graduating, he joined the Daily Express in Manchester. He became New York correspondent for the Express before being poached by the Daily Mail. He went on to edit the Evening Standard and turned down the editorship of The Times to take up the editorship of the Daily Mail. Away from the hectic world of newspapers, Paul Dacre spends his time at home, tending his garden and enjoying family life. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Theodora by George Frideric Handel\nBook: The RHS A-Z encyclopaedia of Garden Plants by Christopher Brickell\nLuxury: A subscription to the Guardian newspaper for one year","first_broadcast_date":"2004-01-25T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Paul Dacre"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093702","title":"Stephen Frears","first_broadcast_date":"2004-01-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936xl","title":"Rt Hon Lord Sainsbury","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936z2","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz3s","duration":2341,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
