In 1998 she became the first female professor of Engineering at Cambridge University and went on to be the first female head of the Department. \n\nAs a child she was fascinated with how things worked, taking her bike apart aged six, and even dismantling the electric lights in her dolls house. Later, an over enthusiastic session with her chemistry set caused the conservatory curtains to briefly catch fire. \n\nA passion for aeroplanes led her down the path of aeroacoustics and aircraft noise reduction alongside her hobby of flying airplanes. \n\nShe was awarded the DBE for services to science in 2007 and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 2016. \n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-07-24T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Dame Ann Dowling"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07klh89","title":"Levi Roots","first_broadcast_date":"2016-07-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07m4gls","title":"Jilly Cooper","first_broadcast_date":"2016-07-31T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b07lf7nr","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p04246jc","duration":2185,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
