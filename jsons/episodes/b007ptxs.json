His stature and influence in folk music is unparalleled - Bono, Elvis Costello and Billy Bragg are among those who cite him as a key influence. A passionate performer, he\u0027s the archetypal Irish poet and protest singer. In the late 1970s Special Branch raided the launch of his album H Block, his songs have been banned by both London and Dublin courts and, as recently as 2004, he was held by police and questioned about his lyrics and lifestyle.\n\nNot all the struggles he\u0027s dealt with have been political. By his own admission he wasted years, maybe even decades, boozing and bingeing on drugs. Having cleaned up his act he was then forced to confront the devastating legacy of his father\u0027s early death and how it affected him throughout his life.\n\nElements of this programme may offend some listeners.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Taimse Im\u0027 Chodladh by Planxty\nBook: Collection of Popular Songs of England \u0026 Scotland by Francis Child\nLuxury: A set of Uillean pipes.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-06-17T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Christy Moore"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007nc7n","title":"Yoko Ono","first_broadcast_date":"2007-06-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007qsrj","title":"Ricky Gervais","first_broadcast_date":"2007-06-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b007ppw9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp05w","duration":2068,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
