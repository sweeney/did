He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the TV series Cracker - one of the top television series of the 1990s - about how much of the central character, Fitz, is modelled on himself, how he feels about the violent world it portrays and about why we are fascinated by criminal psychology. For seven years a writer on Brookside, he\u0027ll be describing how the phenomenal success of Cracker led to the reviving of his previously-rejected scripts for films like Priest and Hearts and Minds. He\u0027ll also be relating how the man who has since made a living out of words had such a bad stammer as a child that he was largely unintelligible. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: When I Fall In Love by Nat King Cole\nBook: Ulysses by James Joyce\nLuxury: Haemorrhoid ointment","first_broadcast_date":"1996-01-14T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jimmy McGovern"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nyw","title":"Christopher Hampton","first_broadcast_date":"1996-01-07T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nxc","title":"Chili Bouchier","first_broadcast_date":"1996-01-21T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nyb","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdry","duration":2107,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
