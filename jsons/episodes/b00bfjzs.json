He\u0027s a man of eclectic musical tastes and talents creating choral works, popular TV show themes like Black Adder and The Vicar of Dibley and movie scores and musicals. His enthusiasm and deep-rooted commitment to his life\u0027s work has regularly propelled him away from the score and onto our television screens where he\u0027s presented award winning documentaries like How Music Works. In January 2007 he was appointed as England\u0027s first ever National Ambassador for Singing, leading a \u00a340 million scheme to improve group singing in primary schools.\n\nHoward says he hears music in his head all the time - and can\u0027t imagine life without it.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The first movement of Introitus from the Durufle Requiem by Maurice Durufle\nBook: The Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank\nLuxury: Ice-cold vanilla vodka and tonics.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-25T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Howard Goodall"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00bbdly","title":"Diane Abbott","first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00bvbzm","title":"Lord Woolf","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-01T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00bfj2s","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp016","duration":2003,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
