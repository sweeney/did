Born just after the outbreak of the Second World War, Margaret Atwood spent much of her childhood in the Canadian outback where her father\u0027s work involved studying insects. She grew up mostly without television, cinema, mains electricity or even a proper road to civilisation. For company she had only her parents and her brother, with whom she wrote \u0022serials, mainly about space travel\u0022.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t until her teens that the urge to write struck seriously, an event she describes as \u0022a large, invisible thumb descended from the sky and pressed down on the top of my head. A poem formed.\u0022 After University, a spell in England and a period teaching early morning classes to engineering students she had her first novel, The Edible Woman, published. Since then she has written nine more novels, four of which were Booker nominated with The Blind Assassin finally winning in 2000. Three of those novels have been made into films: Surfacing, The Handmaid\u0027s Tale and The Blind Assassin. She has also published some dozen books of poetry, five collections of short stories, four books for children and assorted non-fiction titles. Her latest novel, Oryx and Crake, set in a genetically engineered, post-apocalyptic landscape is published on May 5th this year.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Shepherd\u0027s Hymn from Pastoral Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: Stories from 1001 Arabian Nights - traditional \nLuxury: A huge vat of Culpepers Rose Geranium bath salts","first_broadcast_date":"2003-04-13T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Margaret Atwood"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937ls","title":"David Gilmour","first_broadcast_date":"2003-04-06T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938n0","title":"Rory Bremner","first_broadcast_date":"2003-04-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00937l5","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz6h","duration":2165,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
