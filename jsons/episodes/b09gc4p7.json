The way to save the planet, she says, requires a radical rethink which will address what she calls the \u0022unresolved tensions\u0022 between big business and over-consumption.\n\nIt\u0027s no surprise then that her fierce broadsides against the free market ideology have attracted plaudits and opprobrium in equal measure. But, coming from a family steeped in political activism, such polarized reactions come with the territory. Her grandparents were fervent Marxists and she was born in Canada to American activist parents who fled the US in protest against the Vietnam War. Her mother is a feminist filmmaker while her doctor father was heavily involved with the natural birth movement. \n\nGrowing up in the 1980s, she was a committed shopper and self-confessed \u0022teeny bopper.\u0022 But at 19 she experienced a dramatic political awakening - after that, she says, \u0022you had to call yourself a feminist.\u0022 \n\nPresenter Kirsty Young\nProducer Paula McGinley.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-11-26T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Naomi Klein"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b09fjls1","title":"Micky Flanagan","first_broadcast_date":"2017-11-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b09h0bkl","title":"Tim Martin","first_broadcast_date":"2017-12-03T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b09gc2g2","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p05p2d4k","duration":2074,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
