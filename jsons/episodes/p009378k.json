Born in South Africa in 1925, he came to Europe after World War II. For a while he lived in Paris, playing piano in a bar. He rubbed shoulders with Jean Paul Sartre and became friends with one of France\u0027s greatest singer-songwriters Charles Aznavour. The two formed a musical partnership and Kretzmer re-worked many of his songs into English - including the hits Yesterday, When I Was Young and She, which was more recently recorded by Elvis Costello for the film Notting Hill. \n\nHis day job was as a journalist and Kretzmer wrote celebrity profiles for the Daily Express. He says his most memorable interviewees were \u0022writers and fighters\u0022, including George Foreman, Muhammad Ali, Truman Capote and Arthur Miller. But it wasn\u0027t until he was nearly sixty that he had his greatest success. The director Cameron Mackintosh was working on Les Miserables but did not have a \u0027book\u0027 - that is, a set of songs that he could produce. He remembered a chance meeting he\u0027d had with Kretzmer, recalled the songs he\u0027d written and his connection with France - and invited him to write the lyrics. The show has been running in London for the past 19 years and has played all over the world. Now aged 78, he continues to work. He is currently collaborating with the former ABBA musicians, Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus on another musical.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Gymnopedies by Yikin Seow\nBook: The Great War and Modern Memory by Prof Paul Fussell\nLuxury: Zippo Lighter","first_broadcast_date":"2003-10-12T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Herbert Kretzmer"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009379c","title":"Nigella Lawson","first_broadcast_date":"2003-10-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938kz","title":"Bill Cullen","first_broadcast_date":"2003-10-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009378n","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz5c","duration":2035,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
