In his book The Wasp Factory, the teenage protagonist tortures insects, experiments with bombs and kills a brother and a cousin. But, says Iain Banks, that was \u0022just a phase he was going through\u0022. He tells Sue Lawley how, as a writer, he has not developed the filters that most adults do and so views the world with childlike eyes, describing what he sees. And this world, he feels, is very often a violent and terrifying one. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Mohammed\u0027s Radio by Warren Zevon\nBook: The Complete Monty Python Television Scripts by Monty Python\nLuxury: Front Seat Of A Porsche","first_broadcast_date":"1997-08-24T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Iain Banks"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009447g","title":"Eric Sykes","first_broadcast_date":"1997-06-22T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009445y","title":"Cleo Laine","first_broadcast_date":"1997-08-31T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009446q","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfyt","duration":2024,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
