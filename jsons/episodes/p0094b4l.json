The author of six highly acclaimed novels and literary editor of the Observer, he describes how he woke up one morning, at the age of 42, to a raging headache and partial paralysis. He had suffered a stroke and it was to take him more than a year to recover. Later, he was to write a memoir about that process which became not only a guide to other sufferers, but also a love story dedicated to his wife.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Prelude - Cello Suite No 3 by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K Jerome\nLuxury: St John\u0027s Wort","first_broadcast_date":"2000-03-05T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Robert McCrum"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b5f","title":"Sheila Hancock","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b3t","title":"Colin Montgomerie","first_broadcast_date":"2000-03-12T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094b4n","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzpg","duration":2230,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
