He wasn\u0027t always as lauded: at school in West London he was \u0022shoved to one side\u0022 in the belief that the best he could hope for was to earn a living as a manual labourer. Instead he portrays the extremes of what human beings put themselves and others through. Expression is where his heart lies - he describes it as \u0022dancing with ghosts\u0022.\n\nAlong with reaching the top of two professions he has also managed to please the diverging demands of his parents - his father wanted him to get a trade, his mother urged him to do what he wanted.\n\nHe says, \u0022I want to make films that are essential. We\u0027re all going to die and we haven\u0027t got a lot of time on this planet. Life goes very quickly, so we might as well make films people will go to see because they need it or want it.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-09-21T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Steve McQueen"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04d0xfx","title":"Malcolm Gladwell","first_broadcast_date":"2014-08-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04jhmhf","title":"Marin Alsop","first_broadcast_date":"2014-09-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04hml1h","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnybz","duration":2265,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
