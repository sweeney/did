As a student, he changed the face of the Cambridge Footlights review by rejecting jokes on bed-makers and punting and writing a political review instead. In the early 1960s he helped found The Establishment Club with Peter Cook. Writing sketches with John Fortune, they found they were unable to find suitable actors to perform their work, and so took to the stage themselves. Satire, he says, died in the late 1960s and he struggled to make a living, until Rory Bremner hired them. As \u0027The Two Johns\u0027, their dialogues featuring an awkward interviewer and slippery politician have won them much recognition and a BAFTA award.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Repons by Pierre Boulez\nBook: The collected works by Wallace Stevens\nLuxury: 2,000 soft loo rolls","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-28T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Bird"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949ws","title":"Dame Norma Major","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949vh","title":"Professor G\u00e9za Vermes","first_broadcast_date":"2000-06-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00949w3","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzn8","duration":2292,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
