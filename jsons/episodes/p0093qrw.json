Over the last 23 years, he has navigated the White Nile in a hovercraft, travelled around the world through both poles, discovered a lost city and, most recently, he nearly perished in Antarctica. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his unhappy schooldays at Eton, his thwarted ambition to emulate his father\u0027s military career and the problems he has had with his companions on expeditions. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Love Changes Everything by Michael Ball\nBook: Gormenghast by Mervyn Peake\nLuxury: Antisan for insect bites","first_broadcast_date":"1994-04-03T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Ranulph Fiennes"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qsq","title":"Conrad Black","first_broadcast_date":"1994-03-27T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qr6","title":"Roger McGough","first_broadcast_date":"1994-04-10T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qry","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf21","duration":2158,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
