Famous for making pat\u00e9 out of placenta and dining on such delicacies as squirrel and rook in his TV programmes, he has made a name for himself as a cook on the wild side. So perhaps it is not surprising that his first ambition was not to spend his life inside a kitchen but in the great outdoors because, he says, he \u0027wanted to be David Attenborough\u0027.\n\nA stint in the renowned River Cafe in London, however, set him on his way to establishing his own waterside haven for food lovers, his River Cottage in Dorset. From there, he has followed his passion for the environment by campaigning for ethically-produced food, including championing a creature not normally given time on our small screens - the humble supermarket chicken.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Love Reign O\u0027er Me by The Who\nBook: Moby Dick by Herman Melville\nLuxury: Full set of Scuba gear.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-26T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ln1b2","title":"David Mitchell","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-19T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00lr14v","title":"Nicky Haslam","first_broadcast_date":"2009-08-02T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00ltn2h","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzw7","duration":2070,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
