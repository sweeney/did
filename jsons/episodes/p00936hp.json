Sir Tim is best known for his collaborative work with Andrew Lloyd Webber creating some of the best loved musicals of recent years. The duo first teamed up in the late 1960s first producing Joseph and his Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, which is a staple of school end-of-term shows as well as enjoying numerous runs in the West End. The groundbreaking Jesus Christ Superstar followed, and then Evita, depicting the life of Eva Peron.\n\nAs a child growing up in Hertfordshire, he was enchanted by astronomy and cricket and excelled academically. On leaving school, he shunned university and tried his hand with the law. But he had dreams of becoming a pop star or, at the very least, a songwriter, and so he took a job as a management trainee with EMI records. When he met Andrew Lloyd Webber after replying to his request for a \u0027with it\u0027 writer he realised his future lay as a lyricist. Sir Tim was knighted in 1994 and he\u0027s the co-author of the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and a co-founder of Pavilion Books.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Once in Royal David\u0027s City by Gauntlett\nBook: Molesworth by Geoffrey Willans\nLuxury: A telescope","first_broadcast_date":"2004-06-27T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Tim Rice"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938c1","title":"Diana Athill","first_broadcast_date":"2004-06-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936gw","title":"Rt Hon Michael Howard MP","first_broadcast_date":"2004-07-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936hs","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz26","duration":2091,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
