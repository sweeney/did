She\u0027s one of our most popular interviewers and presenters and for 40 years has been a warm, but always incisive, figure on our radio and television airwaves. She grew up in Northern Ireland and first of all thought her career lay in singing - as a young girl she would spend several evenings each week singing in local church halls. Although she moved in to broadcasting, those early years lay the foundation for the success and gave her a confidence performing in front of a crowd and a genuine interest in people and their lives. \n\nShe was among the vanguard of women who tried to have it all - to combine motherhood with a fulfilling career. Her eldest daughter, Caron Keating, followed her into the profession and shared Gloria\u0027s ready warmth and wit. But Caron was just 41 when she died from breast cancer and Gloria\u0027s moving account of her experiences has now touched tens of thousands of people.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Miss You Nights by Cliff Richard\nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: Family photographs","first_broadcast_date":"2006-12-24T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gloria Hunniford"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tst","title":"Arnold Wesker","first_broadcast_date":"2006-12-17T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093trk","title":"Anthony Horowitz","first_broadcast_date":"2006-12-31T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093trs","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp07v","duration":2070,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
