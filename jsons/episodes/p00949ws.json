In her book on the Prime Minister\u0027s residence, Chequers, she revealed how Neville Chamberlain would spend time measuring the girths of his favourite trees, and how Ramsay MacDonald chopped wood every morning dressed in plus-fours. She herself was uncomfortable there, and she remembers the loneliness and stress of being the country\u0027s First Lady. She says her love of music, and her work for charity helped her through the tough times. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Norma by Bellini\nBook: Nine Tailors by Dorothy L Sayers\nLuxury: Solar laptop","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-21T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dame Norma Major"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949xj","title":"Kathleen Turner","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949w1","title":"John Bird","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00949wt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnznb","duration":2089,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
