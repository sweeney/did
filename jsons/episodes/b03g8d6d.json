He believes that too many people have no sense of their true talents and passions, and his internationally renowned talks to teachers, business and government leaders argue that - contrary to popular myth - creativity and innovation can be developed in a deliberate and systematic way. What we need, he thinks, is a learning revolution.\n\nHis own erudition began in a crowded house on Merseyside in the fifties, full of visitors, noise and laughter. His front door was just a hundred yards from Everton football club, but his boyhood dreams of playing for The Blues ended when he contracted polio.\n\nThe first of his six siblings to pass the 11-plus and win a scholarship to one of Liverpool\u0027s best schools, his education would fundamentally shape the rest of his life. He says \u0022If a teacher hadn\u0027t seen something in me that I hadn\u0027t seen in myself, my life might have gone in a very different direction.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-03T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Ken Robinson"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03f87bb","title":"Professor Tanya Byron","first_broadcast_date":"2013-10-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03h7grg","title":"Alfred Brendel","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-15T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03g8d5l","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyh2","duration":2089,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
