In between gigs, rehearsals, recordings and motherhood, she\u0027s found time to travel to Uganda and Liberia as patron of Brass for Africa, with the heartfelt conviction that she can transform the lives of street children by teaching them to play.\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-10-04T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alison Balsom"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06d29bf","title":"Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran","first_broadcast_date":"2015-09-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06gthsz","title":"Lemn Sissay","first_broadcast_date":"2015-10-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06f4yqd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p0341sqs","duration":2161,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
