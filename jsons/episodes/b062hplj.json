Born to Irish parents, as a child he spent his summers visiting his mother\u0027s family in rural County Mayo, in sharp contrast to the Manchester council estate where they lived. He taught himself to play the guitar and loved music: he was road manager for the Inspiral Carpets before joining Liam in Oasis.\n\nTheir debut album in 1994 marked the beginning of the band\u0027s rise to fame as part of the Britpop movement. In 1996 they played in front of 250,000 fans over two consecutive nights at Knebworth and following the Labour landslide in 1997, Noel attended what became known as the Cool Britannia party held in Downing Street by Tony Blair. Oasis won six BRIT Awards and two Ivor Novello Awards before disbanding in August 2009.\n\nHe\u0027s since formed his own band - Noel Gallagher\u0027s High Flying Birds.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-07-19T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Noel Gallagher"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b061pgrv","title":"Imtiaz Dharker","first_broadcast_date":"2015-07-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0638gpq","title":"Professor Monica Grady","first_broadcast_date":"2015-07-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b062hpjw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02x6y91","duration":2180,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
