An interest in engineering runs in the Grimshaw genes - one great-grandfather was responsible for seeing a proper drainage and sanitation system installed in Dublin, while another built dams in Egypt. Nicholas inherited an enormous Meccano set and showed an early interest in construction - his passions were building tree houses and boats. One of his nicknames is \u0027Meccano man\u0027 because of his designs with exposed steel supports. \n\nIn the past 12 years his work has become more widely known and includes the International Terminal at Waterloo, the British Pavilion, for Seville\u0027s Expo \u002792 and, most significantly, the Eden Project. He\u0027s just finished the redevelopment of the Roman Baths at Bath and is now working on Battersea Power Station.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Prelude to Cello Suite No.4 by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: The complete works by Patrick O\u0027Brien\nLuxury: RIBA drawings collection","first_broadcast_date":"2003-12-14T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nicholas Grimshaw"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009374t","title":"Pat Barker","first_broadcast_date":"2003-12-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009372s","title":"Emmylou Harris","first_broadcast_date":"2003-12-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093740","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz4j","duration":2160,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
