If he\u0027s not busy telling us why we should love midges he\u0027s enthusing about the hearing capacity of a barn owl. His passion for animals is clear, what they think of him remains a little more uncertain; he\u0027s been attacked by a baboon, charged by lions and bitten by a puff adder.\n\nHis obsession with the natural world began early when a predictable boyhood fascination for tadpoles and ladybirds grew to encompass mosquito larvae, lizards, snakes and bats. As a teenager he collected badger droppings by day and pogoed with electric blue hair at Clash gigs by night.\n\nThese days he distinguishes himself by his impressive knowledge of his subject and his outspoken views on everything from countryside culls to the problems with cat owners.\n\nHe says, \u0022I\u0027ll never rest until I\u0027ve tried to do my own small bit in terms of changing the environment so it\u0027s a better place. I won\u0027t do it for my grandchildren because I won\u0027t have any and I won\u0027t do it for yours. I\u0027ll do it because it\u0027s the right thing to do.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-10-13T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Chris Packham"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03c2c2p","title":"Carolyn McCall","first_broadcast_date":"2013-10-06T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03ddz8m","title":"Jeremy Hutchinson","first_broadcast_date":"2013-10-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03cd8s5","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyhb","duration":2048,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
