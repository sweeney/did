Her career in insurance began in London in the early 1980s, but she tired of the predominantly male culture of the industry and left the City in 1989 to go travelling for a year. On her return she worked for the Prudential and then for GE Solutions, the insurance arm of General Electrics, where the work took her abroad.\n\nShe left GE in 2006 to turn around a failing Swiss company, before joining the Zurich Insurance Group. Her last role before joining Lloyd\u0027s as CEO in 2014 was as chief executive of Canopius, a privately held Lloyd\u0027s insurer.\n\nIn 2015, she topped a power list of the world\u0027s leading 100 LGBT executives. She is openly bisexual after coming out in 2008 and has been married to her husband since 2013.\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-05-15T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Inga Beale"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b079m78n","title":"Tom Hanks","first_broadcast_date":"2016-05-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07bt72r","title":"Berry Gordy","first_broadcast_date":"2016-05-22T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b07bb17c","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03txkwj","duration":2197,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
