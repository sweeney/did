But his route into photography was circuitous. He began studying law and then economics in his native Peru but finished neither course. He had a short spell in America before arriving in London and he says he immediately loved it here. But the early years were tough; he struggled to convince anyone at the glossy magazines to look at his work. Half the trouble, he says, was that he was ringing people from call boxes - and they would hang up before he\u0027d had time to put in any money. But years of building contacts within the industry - and building trust among his models - have paid off and he is now as much as a celebrity as the women he photographs. His most famous pictures are those he took of Princess Diana looking confident, relaxed and happy, just months before she died. They have now been reprinted for a two-year long exhibition and he says that when he saw them again in the lab, it brought \u0022a knot in his throat\u0022. Mario Testino\u0027s photographs of Diana, Princess of Wales, are being exhibited in the State Apartments at Kensington Palace from 24 November 2005. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Fina Estampa by Caetano Veloso\nBook: Demian  by Hermann Hesse\nLuxury: Own pillow","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-23T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Mario Testino"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935by","title":"Jacqueline Wilson","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-16T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935b6","title":"Boris Johnson MP","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935bf","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0dm","duration":2052,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
