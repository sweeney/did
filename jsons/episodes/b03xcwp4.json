Shrewd, swashbuckling and outspoken, he is now retired from one of the most successful military careers of modern times: so illustrious he\u0027s been knighted twice.\n\nThe campaigns he led in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan are well documented and most recently his counsel against military intervention in both Libya and Syria helped guide the Government through the most complex of international strategic defence decision-making.\n\nHe is possibly less well known for his private passions - tennis, skiing, sailing and the action man credentials must surely be further boosted by the fact that he once spent an evening as Joan Collin\u0027s bodyguard. He\u0027s also partial to a spot of karaoke.\n\nBorn in Egypt into a military family he grew up with some understanding of the very particular strain that comes with a life in the forces. Just as well because in 35 years of marriage he and his wife have moved home 29 times.\n\nHe says: \u0022I see myself as a moral soldier. I do not associate the military with wars and bloodshed in the narrow sense. I associate the military with doing good, bringing down tyrants, with releasing people\u0027s ambitions for their children.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-09T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Richards of Herstmonceux"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03wgy82","title":"Mairi Hedderwick","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03xzx62","title":"Murray Walker","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03xcvxz","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyf5","duration":2219,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
