She is the most widely read female novelist in Turkey today.\n\nBorn in 1971, she was raised by a single working mother and also, for the first ten years of her life, by her grandmother in Ankara. Her mother\u0027s job as a diplomat led to a move to Madrid when Elif was ten years old - and so began a peripatetic life which has taken her to places as diverse as Jordan and Germany, the United States and finally to London where she has lived for the past seven years.\n\nElif wrote her first novels in Turkish, but began writing in English shortly after the start of the new millennium. English, she says, has given her a new freedom to write about sensitive issues in Turkey. Her books draw on diverse cultures and reflect her interest in history, philosophy, spiritualism and Sufism. One commentator has said of her work: \u0022Stepping into the writing of this Turkish-born author for the first time is like breaking through the back of a children\u0027s wardrobe and walking into a whole new multicultural world of lives and histories - and, above all, fabulous stories.\u0022\n\nShe is a regular columnist both for English as well as Turkish papers and also writes lyrics for rock musicians.\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-05-28T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Elif Shafak"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b08qy1sl","title":"Demis Hassabis","first_broadcast_date":"2017-05-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b08skyk9","title":"Sonia Friedman","first_broadcast_date":"2017-06-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b08rpcfc","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p053y242","duration":2110,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Elif Shafak\u0027s Website","url":"http:\/\/www.elifsafak.com.tr\/"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
