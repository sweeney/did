Avant-garde, surprising and often shocking, Vivienne first drew media attention when, in the late 1970s, she founded the punk movement with Malcolm McLaren. These days, though hardly orthodox, she has become more mainstream - in 1990 and 1991 she was named Designer of the Year, and she has just been awarded an OBE in the most recent Honours list. She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her impressive career and revealing that, though fashion has been her life, her first love has always been books.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Sleeping Beauty Panorama, Act 2 by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nBook: A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu by Marcel Proust\nLuxury: Multi-lingual dictionary","first_broadcast_date":"1992-06-28T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Vivienne Westwood"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093xw3","title":"Terry Waite","first_broadcast_date":"1992-06-21T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093xt4","title":"Clare Short MP","first_broadcast_date":"1992-07-05T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093xv3","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfbx","duration":2342,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
