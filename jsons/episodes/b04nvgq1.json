Eric Brown has held the world record for the most flight deck landings - 2,407 - for over 65 years. He was one of only two men on his ship, HMS Audacity, to survive a German U-boat bombing.\n\nIn a long and remarkable life he has witnessed first-hand momentous events in world history, from the Berlin Olympics in 1936 to the liberation of the Belsen concentration camp.\n\nFlying, he believes, is in his blood. He originally climbed into the open cockpit of a Gloster Gauntlet as a child to sit on his father\u0027s knee. Thirty years later he would pilot Britain\u0027s first ever supersonic flight.\n\nHe says: \u0022It\u0027s an exhilarating world to live in. There\u0027s always that aura of risk - you come to value life in a slightly different way.\u0022\n\nProducer: Paula McGinley.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-14T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Captain Eric \u0027Winkle\u0027 Brown"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04n2fn5","title":"Wendy Dagworthy","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04p5m1k","title":"John Agard","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04nvg9d","duration":2580,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyb6","duration":2167,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
