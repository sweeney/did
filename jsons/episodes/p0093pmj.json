Born into a poor family in Coventry, record producer Pete Waterman is nowadays estimated to be worth at least 60 million pounds, and is the proud possessor of 10 Ferraris, 15 Jaguars and several houses and railway engines.\n\nHe\u0027ll be telling Sue Lawley how, with no formal education - and still unable to do joined-up writing - he and his company wrote and produced enough hit records in the mid-1980s to have one in the Top Forty every week for four years.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Tannhauser Overture by Richard Wagner\nBook: R.C.T.S. History of Great Western Railway Engines\nLuxury: Havana cigars and matches","first_broadcast_date":"1995-04-30T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Pete Waterman"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pn9","title":"George Lloyd","first_broadcast_date":"1995-04-23T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093plv","title":"Dr George Carey","first_broadcast_date":"1995-05-07T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pmk","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdwr","duration":2164,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
