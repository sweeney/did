As the Executive Director, Archie Norman made ASDA one of the top three grocers on the high street.\n\nIn the process, he\u0027s answered every one of the 40,000 suggestions from his staff - personally. And he\u0027s learnt how to keep his colleagues on their toes - he\u0027s removed their chairs from the meeting rooms. Now as a new MP and Vice Chairman of the party, can he do the same for the Conservatives?\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Requiem by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: The Complete Angler  by Isaac Walton\nLuxury: Jar of Marmite","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-01T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Archie Norman MP"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943l7","title":"David Pountney","first_broadcast_date":"1998-02-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943jf","title":"Sir Anthony Dowell","first_broadcast_date":"1998-03-08T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943kd","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfwb","duration":2197,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
