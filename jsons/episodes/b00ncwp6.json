A world-class planetary scientist, his first job was for NASA, analysing the lunar samples brought back by Apollo 11. He is best known, though, for being the public face of Beagle 2, the daring mission to search for life on Mars. Although Beagle 2 was unsuccessful, he is adamant that the mission was not a failure. Now it is hoped that the technology developed for the mission to Mars can be used to diagnose TB faster than has ever been possible before.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: As Time Goes By by Johnnie Ray\nBook: Journey into Space by Charles Chilton\nLuxury: A picture of the Clifton Suspension Bridge.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-25T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Colin Pillinger"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00n6x78","title":"Jan Pienkowski","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00nht5f","title":"Jerry Springer","first_broadcast_date":"2009-11-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00ncwhh","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzvb","duration":2078,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
