As one half of the team that created the hit TV show Little Britain, he\u0027s been responsible for dreaming up such characters as Vicky Pollard, the Asbo teenager who swapped her baby for a Westlife CD and Dafydd, the Welsh homosexual who is adamant he\u0027s \u0022the only gay in the village\u0022.\n\nWhen he was six years old his hair fell out and as a result he acquired a certain local notoriety - from then on it simply never occurred to him that he wouldn\u0027t go on to become famous. Just five years ago he was struggling to have his work commissioned and thought of abandoning his career in comedy. Today, he\u0027s one of the most popular and recognisable entertainers in Britain.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: These are the Days of Our Lives by Queen\nBook: The Deeper Meaning of Liff  by Douglas Adams\nLuxury: Favourite London restaurant","first_broadcast_date":"2006-11-26T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Matt Lucas"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ttz","title":"Stephen King","first_broadcast_date":"2006-11-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tt7","title":"Raymond Gubbay","first_broadcast_date":"2006-12-03T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093ttg","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp084","duration":2114,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
