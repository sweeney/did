She\u0027s now written twenty books featuring her creation Horrid Henry and they sell in their millions. \n\nShe sees Horrid Henry as sitting within the long tradition of anarchic characters in children\u0027s literature. She says: \u0022Everyone responds to Henry because I think everyone feels - however conventional they seem on the outside - that they are rebellious and unconventional, and Henry really taps into that.\u0022 \n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2011-11-06T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Francesca Simon"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b016kgtz","title":"Lord Victor Adebowale","first_broadcast_date":"2011-10-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0175519","title":"Anna Scher","first_broadcast_date":"2011-11-18T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b016vyy1","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnytr","duration":2144,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
