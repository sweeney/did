It is 25 years since his \u0027Eureka moment\u0027 - when, pulling an X-ray photograph of his assistant\u0027s genetic code out of the developing tray, he realised he could trace the links between her and her parents and that her own unique genetic profile had been revealed. Over the following years, he was the first person to settle immigration disputes, paternity issues and crimes based on DNA identification - he even found himself confirming the identity of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, who had fled Germany after the end of the Second World War.\n\nAs a boy he had always been fascinated by science - he\u0027d made himself a miniature dissection kit so he could find out how a bumble-bee worked and later, spurred on by that success, he remembers bringing a dead cat home and dissecting it on the dining room table. He owes, he says, a debt of gratitude to his parents, who benignly tolerated him turning their family home into a science lab.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Opening of Fugue in D Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Complete books of Flashman by George MacDonald Fraser\nLuxury: World\u0027s Biggest Church Organ.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-09T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alec Jeffreys"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008d1y8","title":"Steven Isserlis","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008gh41","title":"Paul Weller","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b008fc7s","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp03j","duration":2128,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
