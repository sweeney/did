Born to a young Ethiopian woman who wanted him temporarily fostered while she completed her studies, he was with a family until he was 12. He would spend the next five years in a number of children\u0027s homes where he began to write. On leaving care at 17, he self-published his first book of poetry while on the dole. \n\nSeveral poetry collections, plays and programmes for radio and TV followed and his work has taken him around the world. He was the first poet to be commissioned to write for the 2012 London Olympics and his success has also brought him two doctorates and an MBE for services to literature. He is about to be installed as Chancellor of the University of Manchester, an elected post he will hold for the next seven years. He takes writers\u0027 workshops for care-leavers and set up Culture World, the first black writers\u0027 workshop.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-10-11T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lemn Sissay"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06f4z3h","title":"Alison Balsom","first_broadcast_date":"2015-10-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06j0wf3","title":"Professor Sue Black","first_broadcast_date":"2015-10-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06gthqc","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p034s32f","duration":2092,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03571n7","duration":2092,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
