One of the most prominent intellectuals of our time, he\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about how the English academic establishment has taken decades to accept him despite his early popularity as a Cambridge lecturer, and about the problem of reconciling the love of beauty with great acts of evil.\nHe\u0027ll also be describing how his family left Austria for France in the 1920s and how he was one of only two boys to survive in his class in the largely Jewish lycee he attended in Paris. \n\nWhen asked to select just one record to take to the island, Professor George said that for him, it was all or nothing.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nBook: 500 year ahead calendar and appointment book\nLuxury: Computer","first_broadcast_date":"1996-02-18T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor George Steiner"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ntm","title":"Susan Hill","first_broadcast_date":"1996-02-11T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ns4","title":"Sir Roy Calne","first_broadcast_date":"1996-02-25T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nsv","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdr2","duration":2285,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
