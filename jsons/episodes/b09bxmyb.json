She has won a Bafta award, along with numerous nominations, and she received a Royal Television Society Fellowship in 2016. She has also worked as an actress, and has written for the stage. \n\nKay was born in Leeds and has lived there all her life. It\u0027s also the home of her production company. Her highly successful career now seems worlds away from her early life, when she became pregnant and got married at the age of 16, curtailing her dreams of going to drama school. Later, whilst enjoying motherhood, she decided to return to education, studying for a degree in drama at Bretton Hall College. \n\nUpon graduation, she worked in theatre, then at Granada TV as a scriptwriter on Coronation Street before embarking on her own prolific writing career for TV and theatre. \n\nShe celebrates her Golden Wedding anniversary later this year. \n\nPresenter: Kirsty Young\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-10-29T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Kay Mellor"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b099w3v2","title":"Edna Adan Ismail","first_broadcast_date":"2017-10-22T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b09cvytz","title":"Professor Phil Scraton","first_broadcast_date":"2017-11-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b09bxmxn","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p05kyx5v","duration":2100,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
