Indeed in TV circles the noun \u0022vertuosity\u0022 is defined as \u0022the ability to make enormously successful sitcoms for British television and then sell the formats to the American market\u0022.\n\nThe cast list of her working life is a who\u0027s who of quality broadcasting and includes Jack Lemmon, Galton \u0026 Simpson, Frankie Howerd, Jack Nicholson and most recently Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nShe started out typing Goon Show scripts in the mid 50s, accidentally became an agent, and as a producer she has risen to the very top of her industry, with hits including the rock musical Tommy, the sit-com Men Behaving Badly and the drama series Sherlock.\n\nShe says \u0022it\u0027s terribly important not to know too many rules. If you know rules and obstacles you spend a lot of time dealing with them.
