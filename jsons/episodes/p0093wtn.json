She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her Yorkshire childhood, her venture south to join a dance troupe, and her much-vaunted but nevertheless fleeting appearance as a Tiller Girl. She\u0027ll also be discussing how she made history last year when she became the first woman to be elected Speaker, and also the first to be elected from the opposition benches since 1835.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Rock-A-Bye by Judy Garland\nBook: A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth\nLuxury: Mace of the House of Commons","first_broadcast_date":"1993-06-13T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rt Hon Betty Boothroyd MP"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093wvb","title":"Frank Bruno","first_broadcast_date":"1993-06-06T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093wt3","title":"Joan Baez","first_broadcast_date":"1993-06-20T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093wtp","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf64","duration":2187,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
