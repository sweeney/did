Renowned for his best-selling books about life as an Englishman in France, he\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his years in advertising, and how he coined the catchphrase Nice one, Cyril\u0027, and also about the recent television adaptation of a Year in Provence, which attracted widespread criticism. Criticism and controversy have been a feature of his life since the massive success of his books and he\u0027ll be answering many of the charges levelled against him, amongst them the allegation that he has made fun of the French, presenting them as laughable stereotypes as well as attracting hordes of sightseers to disturb the peace of Provence.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Caruso by Luciano Pavarotti\nBook: The Leopard by Giuseppe di Lampedusa\nLuxury: The menu from his favourite Parisien restaurant","first_broadcast_date":"1993-07-04T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Peter Mayle"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ws6","title":"Sir Leon Brittan","first_broadcast_date":"1993-06-27T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093wr2","title":"Nicholas Hytner","first_broadcast_date":"1993-07-11T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093wrk","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf5n","duration":2207,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
