Over the past 30 years she has painted George Melly, Stephen Fry and Michael Gambon among many others. But in the early years, her subjects were not well known; instead they were characters she saw on the streets or in the bars of South London. People whose faces she would commit to memory so that she could draw them when she returned to her studio. \n\nShe was the first artist to be given a residency at the National Gallery and in 1995 won the Jerwood Prize. But although she remains in great demand as a portrait painter, her work provokes controversy too - her tribute to Benjamin Britten, an enormous scallop shell standing on the shore at Aldeburgh, continues to divide opinion in the town.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Runnin\u0027 Wild by Marilyn Monroe\nBook: The Complete Works of Just William by Richmal Crompton\nLuxury: A wine cellar from All Soul\u0027s, Oxford","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-18T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Maggi Hambling"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009359c","title":"David Hope","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009384s","title":"John Rutter","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009385l","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0d3","duration":2223,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
