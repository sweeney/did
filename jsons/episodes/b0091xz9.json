For more than 20 years he\u0027s been the West End\u0027s leading man - winning stacks of awards, building a hugely successful recording career and attracting a large and loyal army of fans.\n\nHe was a teenage drop-out, but when a teacher encouraged him to go to drama school he suddenly realised what he wanted to do. Success seemed to come easily to him and he quickly took on leading roles in Les Miserables, Aspects of Love and Phantom of the Opera. But at one point he feared he would have to abandon his career; he was on stage performing in Les Miserables when he suffered his first panic attack. They became so severe that he could barely leave his flat and he hated the thought of anyone looking at him. He shut himself away for nearly a year as he tried to work out what was wrong with him and overcome his anxieties.\n\nIn Desert Island Discs he describes how he managed to return to the stage - and reveals the role his partner, Cathy McGowan, has played in rebuilding his confidence.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Sailing By by Ronald Binge\nBook: The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman\nLuxury: Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc from the Marlborough district of New Zealand.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-03-02T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Michael Ball"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0090g5l","title":"David Dimbleby","first_broadcast_date":"2008-02-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0093809","title":"Liz Smith","first_broadcast_date":"2008-03-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0091xhs","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp026","duration":2191,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
