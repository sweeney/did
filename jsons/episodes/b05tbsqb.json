His parents met through the sport - his Australian father was himself a professional, his British mother a keen follower. His father left the family when Bradley was still a toddler and it was his mum, Linda, who helped him pursue his dreams of being a champion cyclist. Inspired by Chris Boardman\u0027s success at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics by the age of 16 he\u0027d won gold, silver and bronze at the Junior National Track Championships and was called up to the National Squad. He was Junior World Champion at 18.\n\nKnighted following his achievements in 2012, he\u0027s soon to attempt the world record for the furthest distance cycled in an hour and plans to return to the track in the Team Pursuit at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-05-10T11:16:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Bradley Wiggins"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b05nsb47","title":"Paul Hollywood","first_broadcast_date":"2015-03-29T11:16:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b05v6glq","title":"Helen Browning","first_broadcast_date":"2015-05-17T11:16:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b05tbsnc","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02s3qt4","duration":2102,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
