He is one of the most popular and unpredictable MPs on the Conservative party benches and, under his editorship, the weekly magazine The Spectator sells more copies than ever before.\n \nAfter Eton and Oxford he made his name as a journalist working for the Daily Telegraph in Brussels. His incisive reports about the future of Europe caused a furore at home and abroad - he claims one of his articles changed the course of European history - and, on returning to London, he hoovered up a number of awards, including columnist of the year and political commentator of the year. But it has not always been plain sailing. His critics say he cannot answer to two masters - and he must choose between politics and journalism - Boris doesn\u0027t necessarily agree!\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Finale of Variations on a theme by Johannes Brahms\nBook: Homer - an Indian paper edition (to translate)\nLuxury: Large pot of French mustard","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-30T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Boris Johnson MP"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935bd","title":"Mario Testino","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935b0","title":"Chris Evans","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935b7","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0dk","duration":2257,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
