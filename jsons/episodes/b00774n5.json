For 11 years he was editor of The Sunday Times. Under him, the paper broke the story of Israel\u0027s nuclear capabilities, revealed the Queen\u0027s dismay at the tone of Margaret Thatcher\u0027s administration and shone a bright light onto the difficulties of Princess Diana and Prince Charles\u0027s marriage. But as well as reporting the news, the paper made headlines too - Andrew Neil steered The Sunday Times through its move to Wapping and the bitter and often violent dispute that followed.\n\nMuch has been made of his rise to be a figure at the heart of the establishment. A grammar school boy who went on to study at Glasgow University, he threw himself into university life; he edited the student newspaper, was a keen young debater and chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students. It seemed as if he was destined for a life in politics - but he decided he wanted to live a little first and then found that while he revelled in the political debate, the life of an MP was not for him. He is now Editor in Chief at Press Holdings and an established and authoritative political broadcaster.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: First Movement of Violin Concerto in D Major by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky \nBook: Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith \nLuxury: Wind-up radio.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-02-25T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Andrew Neil"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00774c4","title":"Grayson Perry","first_broadcast_date":"2007-02-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00774yf","title":"JP Donleavy","first_broadcast_date":"2007-03-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b006x7fb","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp073","duration":2160,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
