She was 28 when she became the fastest person to sail solo around the world, and has been called the \u0027first true heroine of the 21st century\u0027. She still sails with friends and with the charity she set up for children with cancer and leukaemia, but her ambition now is to try to find a way of living the same sustainable existence on land that she lives at sea. When your life depends on it, she says, you realise how scarce food and fuel really are.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Boys of Summer by Don Henley\nBook: SAS Survival Handbook by John \u0027Lofty\u0027 Wiseman\nLuxury: A fluffy purple worm (which has been taken everywhere).","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-04T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dame Ellen MacArthur"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00mtqyr","title":"Barry Manilow","first_broadcast_date":"2009-09-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00n4754","title":"Steve Coogan","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00mz6g8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzvm","duration":2078,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
