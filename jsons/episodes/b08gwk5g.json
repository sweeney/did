After graduating with a degree in Political Science, and working for a major multinational company in London, Jimmy had what he calls an \u0027early midlife crisis\u0027, during which he lost his Catholic faith and was generally unhappy. \n\nHe attended lots of therapy courses in an attempt to find out what would make him happier and eventually set out on the road to becoming a comedian. \n\nHe quickly got a reputation for his fierce work ethic, heading up annually to the Edinburgh Fringe, touring with a new show virtually every year, and hosting many a Channel 4 panel show including 8 Out of 10 Cats and the Big Fat Quiz of the Year.\n\nHe has also made a name for himself by becoming what he has called \u0022the king of the inappropriate\u0022, drawing criticism for making jokes about sensitive subjects.\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-03-05T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jimmy Carr"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b08g3m98","title":"Dame Katherine Grainger","first_broadcast_date":"2017-02-26T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b08hl8tr","title":"Marian Keyes","first_broadcast_date":"2017-03-12T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b08gwjrr","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p04vj6c4","duration":2118,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
