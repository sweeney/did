To Radio 4 listeners, he\u0027s best known as Chairman Humph who has spent more than 30 years picking his bewildered way through the innuendo and mayhem of I\u0027m Sorry I Haven\u0027t a Clue. \n\nBut his first love is jazz - as a child, he was always fascinated by music and when he was a teenager it was Louis Armstrong who inspired him to take up the trumpet. Fittingly, Armstrong went on to hail Humph as \u0027Britain\u0027s top trumpetman\u0027. Now aged 85, Humph is still recording and touring with his band and says that he finds he\u0027s kept awake at night by new ideas for music they can play together.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: That\u0027s My Home by Louis Armstrong\nBook: Collected works by James Thurber\nLuxury: A keyboard","first_broadcast_date":"2006-11-05T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Humphrey Lyttelton"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tyn","title":"Heston Blumenthal","first_broadcast_date":"2006-10-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tvz","title":"Lord Stevens","first_broadcast_date":"2006-11-17T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093tx8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp08d","duration":2180,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
