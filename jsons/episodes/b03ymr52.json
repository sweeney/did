It was through Michael Buerk\u0027s landmark news reports of the Ethiopian famine 30 years ago that she first grabbed our attention. We saw her as a young nurse surrounded by thousands of starving people and forced, daily, to make the truly terrible decision of choosing who to feed.\n\nThroughout the years she\u0027s won numerous plaudits and awards: her Florence Nightingale Medal is given \u0022to honour those \u0022who\u0027ve distinguished themselves in times of war by exceptional courage and devotion to the wounded, sick or disabled.\u0022\n\nShe says, \u0022I don\u0027t live just to eat and sleep and get money to have a nice house ... I have to create value - I have to do something in life.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dame Claire Bertschinger"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03xzx62","title":"Murray Walker","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03z3l2g","title":"Sir Andre Geim","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03ymqws","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnydz","duration":2196,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
