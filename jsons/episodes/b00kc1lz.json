As the unassuming Clegg in Last of the Summer Wine and the equally mild-mannered Wallace in Wallace and Gromit, Sallis brings to life a sepia-tinted Britain that barely seems to exist any more. Now aged 88 and with failing eyesight, no-one, he says, is more surprised at his success than himself: \u0022I\u0027ve been lucky enough to keep going and I realise now, though it\u0027s taken me nearly 100 years, that my voice is distinctive. I\u0027m very lucky indeed.\u0022\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The finale of Symphony No.5 in E flat Major by Jean Sibelius\nBook: The collected works by P G Wodehouse\nLuxury: No.7 Meccano outfit.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-05-17T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Peter Sallis"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00k7qyn","title":"Whoopi Goldberg","first_broadcast_date":"2009-05-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00khkxy","title":"Barry Humphries","first_broadcast_date":"2009-05-24T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00kc1jn","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzx6","duration":2178,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
