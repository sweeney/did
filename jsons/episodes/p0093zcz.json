His Low Life column has gained him something of a cult following over the 15 years or so it\u0027s been appearing; slightly irregularly. It concentrates on the kind of life in Soho which seems often to revolve solely around drinking, women and gambling - the kind of life Jeffrey Bernard enjoys, by his own admission. And of course, last year Keith Waterhouse turned some of these columns into the highly-successful West End hit Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell - a production starring Peter O\u0027Toole which is about to return to the Shaftesbury Theatre next month.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Introitus Requiem Mass by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: Complete Sherlock Holmes Short Stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\nLuxury: Hgih-powered hunting rifle and ammunition","first_broadcast_date":"1991-03-10T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jeffrey Bernard"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zdr","title":"Sir Denis Forman","first_broadcast_date":"1991-03-03T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zcb","title":"Sir Trevor Holdsworth","first_broadcast_date":"1991-03-17T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zd0","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfks","duration":2196,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
