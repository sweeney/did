Born in 1957 and brought up near Lake Como, Radice is the son of a furniture retailer. He surprised himself and his family by studying agriculture at Milan University, but he was never destined to become a farmer. His military service he insists entailed nothing much more pressing than typing and taking the general\u0027s wife shopping, but this seems to have been the last period of treading water in his life. After leaving the army he joined Associated Merchandising Corporation, one of the largest global buying organisations and by the age of 30 he was Head of Worldwide Sourcing for its Home department. \n\nIn 1990 he joined Habitat International as Buying Director, and two years later was appointed Managing Director, transforming the company\u0027s losses of \u00a37 million into profits of over \u00a314 million. In 1996 he was headhunted to join Selfridges as Managing Director, quickly becoming Chief Executive and transforming its fortunes. This year he has joined Marks \u0026 Spencer Plc as Executive Director for the Home Group.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Birima by Youssou N\u0027dour\nBook: La premi\u00e8re gorg\u00e9e de Bi\u00e8re et autres plaisirs minuscules by Philippe Delerm\nLuxury: Sunglasses","first_broadcast_date":"2003-06-08T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Vittorio Radice"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937fy","title":"Meera Syal","first_broadcast_date":"2003-06-01T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938m5","title":"Mark Tully","first_broadcast_date":"2003-06-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00937f8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz5x","duration":2012,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
