The British public have taken Slater and his recipes to their hearts and - crucially - their kitchens in recent years, encouraged by his philosophy that cooking need not be daunting. Don\u0027t cook to show off, he says, or because you feel you should - cook for enjoyment, and comfort. Choose good ingredients, cook them simply, and above all - relax. \n\nSlater\u0027s passion for food grew out of a lonely, neglected childhood in which his only comforts were culinary. Born in Wolverhampton in the late 50s, his mother died when he was just nine leaving a gap in his life which he tried to fill with comfort food. Against his father\u0027s wishes, he fantasised about being a chef, later leaving home to go to catering college and then work in a variety of restaurants around the country. After testing recipes for a new magazine, he first came to public attention as food editor for Marie Claire. \n\nCurrently food editor of the Observer, Slater\u0027s books are both popular and critically acclaimed. His 2003 memoir Toast won biography of the year at the British Book Awards, his cookbook Appetite won an Andre Simon for Cookbook of the Year in 2000, and Slater himself has won the Glenfiddich Trophy and Cookery Writer of the Year Award in 1999.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Teddy Bears Picnic by Henry Hall and Val Rosing\nBook: Derek Jarman\u0027s Garden  by Derek Jarman\nLuxury: Howard Hodgkin\u0027s painting Learning About Russian Music","first_broadcast_date":"2005-06-05T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nigel Slater"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935lq","title":"Satish Kumar","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935jt","title":"Betsy Blair","first_broadcast_date":"2005-06-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935kw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0fl","duration":2046,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
