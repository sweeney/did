He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about how, as a music critic on the Sunday Times for over 40 years, he has lived at the epicentre of 20th-century musical life - meeting such luminaries as Poulenc, Messiaen, Delius and the French organist and composer, Charles-Marie Widor. He\u0027ll also be discussing his views on the contemporary music scene, and describing his house in North London where, now aged 80, he lives surrounded by musical artefacts, literature and scores that have accumulated over his long career.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Christ Der Ein\u0027ge Gottes Sohn by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Du Cote De Chez Swann by Marcel Proust\nLuxury: Swiss army knife","first_broadcast_date":"1995-03-19T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Felix Aprahamian"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093prw","title":"Nigel Nicolson","first_broadcast_date":"1995-03-12T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pqk","title":"Nina Bawden","first_broadcast_date":"1995-04-02T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pr7","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdxf","duration":2289,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
