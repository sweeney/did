He came to public attention when he presented the television programme The Great Egg Race, in which he challenged people to conquer engineering problems with a rubber band, a pencil and a pickled onion. In the 1970s while designing aids for disabled people, he devised the phrase \u0027Tools for Living\u0027 to describe his work. After all, as he points out, we all use tools to cope with our environment, whether as an astronaut, a diver or an elderly person. \n\nIt was his father who encouraged his enthusiasm for invention, sharing his Sunday afternoons experimenting with his chemistry set, or organising talks from physicists who had to hide their surprise at assessing the ideas of a six-year-old child. In the 80s he founded the Institute for Bioengineering at Brunel University. There he continued his inventions devising for example, a box for experimenting in outer space, a voice machine for people who can\u0027t speak and a safety system for deep-sea divers.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: The Man I Love by Joan Wolff\nBook: Collection of Landscape Pictures (with book)\nLuxury: A Collection Of Landscape Pictures","first_broadcast_date":"1998-01-04T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Heinz Wolff"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943rz","title":"Glenda Jackson MP","first_broadcast_date":"1997-12-28T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943pt","title":"Paul Hogarth","first_broadcast_date":"1998-01-11T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943r4","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfx2","duration":2042,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
