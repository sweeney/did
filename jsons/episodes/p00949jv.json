At the age of 17 Ronald Harwood left his home in South Africa and set sail for England, determined to become an actor. When that failed he turned his hand successfully to writing. Some plays, like The Dresser, draw on his theatrical experiences, others, like Articles of Faith deal with the political dilemmas. He leaves behind his thought-provoking work to join Sue Lawley on the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Emperor Concerto No 5 in E Flat, Opus 73 by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: Decline and Fall by Evelyn Waugh\nLuxury: My bathroom","first_broadcast_date":"2000-08-27T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ronald Harwood"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949kl","title":"Christopher Lloyd","first_broadcast_date":"2000-08-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949j1","title":"J K Rowling","first_broadcast_date":"2000-11-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00949jw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzm0","duration":2163,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
