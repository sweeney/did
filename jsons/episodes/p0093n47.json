He describes his books as comedies, but, like London Fields and Other People, they are frequently dark and disturbing.\n\nHe says that he has no choice as to the subjects of his books. \u0022They come from nowhere and feel like a little gulp in your digestive system\u0022. Although he admits that he\u0027s sometimes appalled by the characters he creates, writing itself is something he loves. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Yesterdays by Buddy Rich\nBook: Complete Works by John Milton\nLuxury: Cable Television","first_broadcast_date":"1996-12-29T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Martin Amis"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n4f","title":"Jennifer Saunders","first_broadcast_date":"1996-12-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00944v0","title":"John Cleese","first_broadcast_date":"1997-01-05T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093n48","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdld","duration":2251,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
