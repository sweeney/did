In the 1990s the brand went international and the fragrance made her fortune when she sold the business.\n\nIf this all sounds like a fragrant little fairy tale, crisply wrapped in a signature black grosgrain bow, it isn\u0027t. Severely dyslexic she left school at 14. Her dad was a talented painter but a chronic gambler too, and home life was sometimes hand-to-mouth. Later, and at a time in her life when she should have been enjoying her success and her toddler son, she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Finally fully recovered she decided to start again from scratch.\n\nShe says, \u0027I love sharing my story, and I\u0027m not frightened of people seeing the cracks as well as the strengths. I think the things that are sad and difficult are just as important.\u0027\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-11T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jo Malone"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04wrwmd","title":"Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04y9nl6","title":"Julia Cleverdon","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04xmp8s","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny98","duration":2059,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
