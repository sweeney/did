His novels include Rabbit Run (and three Rabbit follow-ups), Couples and The Witches of Eastwick.\n\nHe is both poet and historian, famous for charting the changes in post-war American society such as increasing marital breakdown and changing attitudes to death. He started his writing career by selling stories to the New Yorker magazine - something his mother had tried for years but had never succeeded. And he\u0027ll be telling Sue Lawley about how he overcame a bad stutter, how he has learnt to control his psoriasis and how now, aged 63, he finally feels normal; part of the gang he never was as a teenager. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Sing, Sing, Sing by The Benny Goodman Orchestra\nBook: Complete Works by Marcel Proust\nLuxury: Silken tent (for luxury, not survival)","first_broadcast_date":"1995-09-10T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Updike"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pcv","title":"Wendy Richard","first_broadcast_date":"1995-07-09T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pbh","title":"Max Nicholson","first_broadcast_date":"1995-09-17T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pc4","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdvb","duration":2244,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
