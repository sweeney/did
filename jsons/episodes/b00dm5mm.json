Her rich career has seen her work with directors such as Martin Scorsese and Baz Luhrmann and she\u0027s won awards and acclaim for her film work, her theatre performances and her book readings. She made the leap from the Cambridge Footlights to become one of our most successful and popular character actresses. Yet, despite having one of the most sought after voices in the business, she says she hasn\u0027t had the career that she aspired to. She yearned to be taken more seriously and given meatier roles but, she jokes, Joan Plowright always stood in her way. On stage she seems to have the confidence and chutzpah of someone who is beyond embarrassment - but in reality, she says, for most of her life she has simply been a \u0027frightened little muffin\u0027.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The opening of the Fourth movement of the Trout Quintet by Franz Schubert\nBook: Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: A flush toilet.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-09-28T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Miriam Margolyes"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00czqsp","title":"Ruthie Henshall","first_broadcast_date":"2008-08-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00dqctb","title":"David McVicar","first_broadcast_date":"2008-10-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00dm5l2","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzzr","duration":2211,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
