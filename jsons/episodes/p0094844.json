The son of Princess Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon has always made a point of playing down his royal connections. Having set up his own company specialising in bespoke furniture, David Linley is now one of the country\u0027s most fervent advocates for modern craftsmanship. In conversation with Sue Lawley, he talks about his life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Piano Concerto in C Minor K.491: 2nd Movement by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: The Art of Looking Sideways by Alan Fletcher\nLuxury: A guitar","first_broadcast_date":"2002-02-03T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Linley"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094851","title":"Phyllis Sellick","first_broadcast_date":"2002-01-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094839","title":"Sir Paul Nurse","first_broadcast_date":"2002-02-10T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094845","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzfb","duration":1991,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
