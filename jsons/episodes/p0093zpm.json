One of his positions is Her Majesty\u0027s Sculptor In-ordinary for Scotland - a post rather like the Poet Laureate for Sculpture, but with no duties attached to it. But such eminence in the artistic world is in stark contrast to Sir Eduardo\u0027s humble beginnings as the son of Italian immigrants who had an ice-cream shop in Edinburgh. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his boyhood, when he was sent to Fascist youth camps in Italy for three months at a time, and the subsequent imprisonment and vilification which fell upon him and his family at the outbreak of war in 1940. He\u0027ll also be contemplating his years at the Slade and his flight to the artistic freedom of the Paris of Giacometti, Leger and Picasso. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: L\u0027Enfant Et Les Sortileges by Maurice Ravel\nBook: A tropical plant book in Italian with English gloss\nLuxury: Hurdy gurdy","first_broadcast_date":"1990-12-02T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Eduardo Paolozzi"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zql","title":"Baroness Trumpington","first_broadcast_date":"1990-11-25T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093znw","title":"Brian Keenan","first_broadcast_date":"1990-12-23T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zpn","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcm3","duration":2269,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
