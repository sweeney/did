A top flight TV executive known for being instinctual and populist, his appointment as BBC Director-General was an uncharacteristically bold move for the corporation and an extraordinary moment for a youngster once marked out by his teachers as \u0027the boy least likely to succeed\u0027. A natural businessman who relishes taking risks, his greatest successes have come from his ability to spot the moment and act quickly. He saved TV-am with Roland Rat, moved the BBC\u0027s Nine O\u0027Clock News at a fortnight\u0027s notice and thwarted Rupert Murdoch\u0027s digital hopes by backing Freeview. \n\nBut his critics say that it is his passion and instinct that ultimately led to his downfall. He was forced to resign from the BBC after a bitter row that erupted between the corporation and Downing Street about its coverage of the Iraq war. His departure, which followed considerable mud-slinging, ill temper and tragedy, prompted a huge display of loyalty from his staff as thousands gathered on the steps to wish him a tearful goodbye. Since then, he\u0027s kept a low profile - but doesn\u0027t rule out a return to high office if the right job came along.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Like a Rolling Stone by Bob Dylan\nBook: Complete Works by Dylan Thomas\nLuxury: A guitar with a guide to playing it.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-05-20T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Greg Dyke"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007gtsn","title":"Joanna Lumley","first_broadcast_date":"2007-05-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007lsc5","title":"Paul McKenna","first_broadcast_date":"2007-05-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b007j70t","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp069","duration":2027,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
