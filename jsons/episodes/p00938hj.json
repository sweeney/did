Best known as the \u0027Blonde Bombshell\u0027, Lily Savage, he\u0027s one of the most popular figures on television with his outrageous clothes and wigs. Originally from Tranmere in Birkenhead, Paul worked as a social worker for Camden Council as well as working part time in pubs around London in the 1980s. His talent as a drag artist was discovered at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern in South London after he stood in for the compere who\u0027d rung in sick.\n\nHe got his first big break on Channel 4\u0027s Big Breakfast replacing Paula Yates in 1995. Since then he\u0027s hosted Blankety Blank and his own Lily Savage Show as well as the sitcom Eyes Down, set in a bingo hall in Liverpool. He\u0027ll also be following in the footsteps of Bruce Forsyth, Larry Grayson and Jim Davidson by fronting a new series of the show the Generation Game. Paul\u0027s recently scaled down work commitments after suffering a heart attack last April. He was given angioplasty and has made a full recovery but he now says he\u0027s taking life easier and cutting down on drink and cigarettes.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Meditation from Thais.
