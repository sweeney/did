It\u0027s been five years since he rocked the foundations of the BBC with what became known as the Ross Brand scandal. He\u0027s since gone on to international success with a movie career, best-selling books and all the trappings of life on the \u0022A\u0022 list.\n\nHis most recent notable appearances have included testifying to a Parliamentary Select Committee on the importance of funding for drugs rehabilitation programmes and an appearance as a panellist on Question Time.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-21T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Russell Brand"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b036tqpl","title":"Val McDermid","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b037gm1f","title":"Mary Robinson","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0374wgw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyjl","duration":2041,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
