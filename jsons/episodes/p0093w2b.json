Kelly Holmes was the heroine of the Athens Olympics. She achieved her lifetime\u0027s ambition when, at the age of 34, she won gold medals in the 800 and 1500 metres.\n\nAs a teenager she witnessed Sebastian Coe\u0027s Olympic success in 1984 and that was the inspiration behind her own career in athletics. Early on her trainers recognised she had the natural talent - and determination - to succeed. But her career has been blighted by injury - she bowed out of the 1996 Olympics due to injury; won a bronze medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics despite considerable physical pain; and several times had appeared close to the end of her career as a result of a series of health problems.\n\nNow retired from athletics, she says she wants to inspire other schoolchildren to take up sport - and make sure that the whole of Britain feels the Olympic spirit by the time it comes to host the games in 2012.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: If I Ain\u0027t Got You by Alicia Keys\nBook: A Set of Encyclopaedias\nLuxury: Large supply of chocolate","first_broadcast_date":"2006-01-01T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Kelly Holmes"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009384s","title":"John Rutter","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093w1l","title":"Richard Griffiths","first_broadcast_date":"2006-01-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093w2d","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0cz","duration":2085,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
