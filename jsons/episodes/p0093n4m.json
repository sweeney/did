Ian Dury and the Blockheads were part vaudeville act and part punk rock band. In his songs, he created the characters Clevor Trever and Billericay Dickie and so invented the original Essex Man. He\u0027s also a painter and an actor, but as he reveals to Sue Lawley, he\u0027s writing songs again and hopes to be back in the charts soon.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Ramblin by Ornette Coleman\nBook: Macmillan Dictionary of Art\nLuxury: Mixing Desk - Solar Powered","first_broadcast_date":"1996-12-15T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ian Dury"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n4w","title":"Robert Winston","first_broadcast_date":"1996-12-08T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n4f","title":"Jennifer Saunders","first_broadcast_date":"1996-12-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093n4n","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdln","duration":2049,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
