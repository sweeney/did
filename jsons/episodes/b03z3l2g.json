And it was perhaps her small weather station on the beach that sparked an early interest in science. As a student his intellect was rigorous but his timing was also spot on:\u0022glasnost\u0022, the political movement that swept open the Iron Curtain, enabled him to travel and study throughout Europe, finally settling at Manchester University.\n\nIt was his work developing the substance graphene that won him science\u0027s highest prize. Graphene has many exciting properties: it is the thinnest and strongest material ever discovered; using it, electricity can travel a million meters a second; it has unique levels of light absorption and is flexible and stretchable.\n\nOf his research he says, \u0022It\u0027s like being Sherlock Holmes but being a detective of science. It\u0027s trying to find things out using very limited information ... like a hair on your coat, or dirt on your shoes, or some lipstick - the winner is the one who needs the fewest hints to get the answer\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-30T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Andre Geim"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03ymr52","title":"Dame Claire Bertschinger","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b042z660","title":"Jack Dee","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03z3l1j","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnydv","duration":2223,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
