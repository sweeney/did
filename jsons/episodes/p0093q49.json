He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his childhood and his first realisations that black children were treated very differently from their white counterparts, as well as his initial work as a teacher, which he gave up when he realised he was expected merely to train his black pupils for a life of service. He\u0027ll also be talking about the new freedom and responsibilities of South Africa following the election of Nelson Mandela earlier this year, and describing his optimism for its success. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: We Are The World by U.S.A.
