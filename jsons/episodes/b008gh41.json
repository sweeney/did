As the lead singer of The Jam, the founder of The Style Council and a hugely successful solo artist, he is one of the most revered music writers and performers of the past 30 years and is cited as an influence by countless other singers.\n\nIn a rare interview, he describes the chronic shyness he had to overcome; how he is still gripped by fear before each performance and how, after he had been dumped by his record label, he was unable to write songs and found that even picking up a guitar felt alien to him. His father has been a constant support to him - as his mentor as well as his manager - and has always believed that his son had something special.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Tin Soldier by The Small Faces\nBook: Absolute Beginners by Colin MacInnes\nLuxury: A settee to sit on.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-16T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Paul Weller"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008fcdz","title":"Alec Jeffreys","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008kkcg","title":"Victoria Wood","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b008ggvf","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp03f","duration":2110,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
