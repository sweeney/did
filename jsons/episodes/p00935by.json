She\u0027s won just about every award going for children\u0027s fiction and, in a career spanning more than 30 years, has written more than 80 books. Even as a child she knew she wanted to write but, after an inauspicious time at school, she reluctantly trained to be a secretary instead. Then she began to pitch ideas for a new teen magazine, Jackie, her stories were bought and she quickly became a staff writer.\n \nBut she was 50 before she devised her most famous creation, Tracy Beaker. Tracy is a streetwise, feisty girl growing up in the competitive world of a children\u0027s home, who never loses the hope that one day her mum will come back for her. The book was a breakthrough for Jacqueline and its subsequent television adaptation introduced her to a mass audience. In 2002 she was awarded an OBE for services to literacy. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No 5 in E flat by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The collected works by Katherine Mansfield\nLuxury: A fairground carousel","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-16T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jacqueline Wilson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935cm","title":"Michael Winner","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935bd","title":"Mario Testino","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935bz","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0dp","duration":2093,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
