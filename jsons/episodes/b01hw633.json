He was appointed literary editor of The Spectator when he was just 23 and has gone on to write dozens of books since. He has written a biography of London, as well as books about people he calls \u0027cockney visionaries\u0027 such as Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins and, now, Charlie Chaplin. Yet, of the work he\u0027s produced so far, he says: \u0022Every book for me is a chapter in the long book which will finally be closed on the day of my death. So that final book is the one which gives me a sense of achievement.\u0022\n\nProducer: Christine Pawlowsky.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-05-20T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Peter Ackroyd"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01hdqmd","title":"Baroness Hollins","first_broadcast_date":"2012-05-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01j2fdt","title":"Denise Robertson","first_broadcast_date":"2012-05-27T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01hw4zt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyqb","duration":2373,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
