A romantic at heart, he regrets that so much written about nature these days concentrates on the scientific. Unlike past writers like WH Hudson or Gilbert White, he says we rarely confess our feelings and emotions about the countryside. What interests him is our relationship with nature; how we name our streets and houses after flowers, why children still whack conkers, and the reasons we bring holly and mistletoe into our homes at Christmas. He himself has a special relationship with the nightingale - he describes how, in times of distress and depression, he can always find comfort in its song.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: La Delaissado (The Abandoned) by Joseph Canteloube\nBook: The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame\nLuxury: Guitar","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-26T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Richard Mabey"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943zz","title":"Richard Rodney Bennett","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-19T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943yg","title":"John Julius Norwich","first_broadcast_date":"1997-11-02T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943z5","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfxz","duration":2212,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
