In 1950, she earned a place at The Royal College of Art to study textile design and moved to London. As Britain emerged from the austerity of the war years, Pat began her career designing bold and exciting fabrics for the fashionable dress design company of the time, Horrocks. In the 60 years that have followed, her designs have graced pottery, paper, furnishing fabrics as well as over 300 tea towels - a record which has brought her the unofficial title \u0027Queen of the Tea Towel\u0027.\n\nProducer: Isabel Sargent.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-03-22T11:16:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Pat Albeck"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b055dzb9","title":"Robin Millar","first_broadcast_date":"2015-03-15T11:16:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b05nsb47","title":"Paul Hollywood","first_broadcast_date":"2015-03-29T11:16:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b05mpwwg","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny84","duration":2144,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
