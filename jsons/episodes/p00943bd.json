After an out-of-body experience, psychologist Susan Blackmore set out to study and prove the existence of the paranormal. Twenty years on, she\u0027s a convinced sceptic.\n\nShe continues, however, to be fascinated by the question of consciousness. In particular, the new theory of memes which examines how habits and beliefs are passed on from one person to another.

At their best, they\u0027re responsible for our co-operation and kindness.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Not Fade Away by Grateful Dead\nBook: Origin of Species by Charles Darwin\nLuxury: A handful of cannabis seeds","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-03T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Susan Blackmore"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943bz","title":"Sir Ernest Hall","first_broadcast_date":"1998-04-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009439n","title":"Antony Gormley","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943bf","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfvh","duration":2142,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
