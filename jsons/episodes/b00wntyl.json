They now hold the same place in the nation\u0027s heart at Christmas that Morcambe and Wise once occupied. They are old-fashioned and quintessentially British - as familiar as bread and butter, or hoping the rain holds off - but their appeal is international. \n\nThe world they inhabit is one of Jacobs cream crackers and tea-strainers - so it\u0027s little surprise that in real life too Nick Park\u0027s own creature comforts are modest: \u0022The thing is, I have everything I want really. I\u0027ve got my little house, I\u0027ve got a campervan, I love the British countryside, I\u0027m not after yachts or things like that.\u0022\n\n\nRecord: I Forgot that Love Existed - Van Morrison\nBook: A Collins Bird book \nLuxury: My own \u0027Amazing pair of binoculars\u0027 \n\n\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-19T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nick Park"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00wlbhr","title":"Sir Torquil Norman","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-12T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00wr4hx","title":"Sandie Shaw","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-26T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00wnsrt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyyq","duration":2180,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
