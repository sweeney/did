He left school at fifteen and became an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department of Ilkley Urban District Council, going on to horticultural college at the age of 18. His interest in English literature and writing prompted him to apply for a job as assistant editor of gardening books at Hamlyn Publishing and he began to write gardening books of his own, publishing his first in 1976. \n\nAlan experienced his first taste of television when there was a plague of greenfly on the south coast and he was approached to report on it in Margate for Nationwide. He says, \u0022I suddenly tasted blood. It was wow!, I like this. I want to do more.\u0022 He became a presenter of Daytime Live, a Birmingham-based chat show, interviewing stars like Placido Domingo, Barry Manilow and Julia Roberts. He also presented Songs of Praise but never forgot his gardening, and took to the screens as a gardener with the amazingly successful garden make-over programme, Ground Force, in 1997. As well as presenting the more \u0027serious\u0027 gardening programme, Gardener\u0027s World, Alan recently took viewers back to basics with the series How to be a Gardener and, having written a grand total of thirty-seven gardening books, he remains the UK\u0027s premier gardener.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams\nBook: One of the \u0027Blandings\u0027 novels  by P G Wodehouse\nLuxury: A box of watercolours","first_broadcast_date":"2002-07-07T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alan Titchmarsh"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947mj","title":"Minette Walters","first_broadcast_date":"2002-06-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947l2","title":"Brian May","first_broadcast_date":"2002-09-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00947lw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz99","duration":2222,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
