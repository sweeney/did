Judith Kerr escaped with her family on the day the Nazis were elected. The following day, police turned up at the doorstep in a belated attempt to confiscate their passports. The Kerr family moved across Europe, trying to support themselves and escape from the nearing threat, until they eventually settled in England in 1936. The family stayed in London throughout the war; surviving the Blitz and in fear of invasion. Judith Kerr wrote an autobiographical trilogy about her experiences and the books - in particular When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit - have been used ever since as a way of explaining to children the horrors of the Nazi threat. Today, they are set texts in many German schools.\n\nShe was always a keen painter but had never thought it could be a career; it was only when she had two children who enjoyed the tales she told that she decided to try her hand at picture books. Her first book, The Tiger Who Came to Tea, was instantly successful when it was published in 1968 and has never been out of print. But it is probably her series of books about Mog the Cat that have won her most affection with children - over the past 30 years they have sold more than three million copies.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Kyrie - the Opening of Great Mass in C Minor by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: A big, beautiful coffee table book of pictures by impressionists\nLuxury: Pencils and thick paper to write and draw on","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-29T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Judith Kerr"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936tc","title":"John Cale","first_broadcast_date":"2004-02-22T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938gm","title":"Sir Gulam Noon","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936sm","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz3b","duration":2192,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
