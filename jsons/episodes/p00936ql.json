Ralph Kohn is a Jewish businessman who has won the Queen\u0027s Export Award for his work in the pharmaceutical industry and he\u0027s also a renowned Baritone singer .\n\nOriginally born into a privileged family in Leipzig, Germany, his family moved to Amsterdam in response to the anti-Semitic laws passed in Hitler\u0027s Germany in the 1930s. The Kohns finally settled in Manchester and Ralph excelled at school, eventually choosing to study pharmaceuticals at university, encouraged by the major drug developments of the 1950s. As a doctoral student, he met Alexander Fleming and went on to work with two Nobel prize winners in Italy. It was in Rome that Ralph\u0027s love of singing flourished; learning under the renowed teacher Manlio Marcantoni, who introduced him to the great Opera tenor Gigli. In the 1960s and 1970s Ralph worked for numerous major pharmaceutical companies including Smith Kline French and Robapharm before setting up his own company Advisory Services Clinical Ltd in 1969. In music he\u0027s appeared at the Wigmore Hall, The Queen Elizabeth and Albert Halls and John Smith Square as well as producing twelve CDs.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Sinfonia from Christmas Oratorio by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: The complete works by Bach\nLuxury: A magic flute","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-21T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ralph Kohn"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936rm","title":"Bill Nighy","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-14T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938g2","title":"Jack Vettriano","first_broadcast_date":"2004-03-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936qn","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz34","duration":2249,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
