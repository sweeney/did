At 18 she went to Florence to immerse herself in Italian style, and ended up deep in the world of Florentine leather, getting samples made up of a duffel bag she\u0027d spotted. An initial run of 500 bags sold out. Fast forward 25 years and her eponymous fashion business is globally successful with her designs much sought after.\n\nShe\u0027s also known for her conscience and designed a canvas tote called \u0022I\u0027m not a plastic bag\u0022 as part of an environmental campaign to highlight our over use of plastic bags.\n\nShe combines all this with a hectic family life. She met and subsequently married a widower 12 years her senior when she was 25. He had 3 children aged under 5 and they\u0027ve added a further two to the clan.\n\nShe says her life is like \u0022juggling and dancing while having one arm and one eye at the same time\u0022.\n\n\n\n\nProducer: Alison Hughes.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-30T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Anya Hindmarch"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01pf6dx","title":"Dawn French","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01pnlt4","title":"Sir Howard Stringer","first_broadcast_date":"2013-01-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01ph59n","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnymc","duration":2022,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
