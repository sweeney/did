She took up the piano aged two, swapped to the violin at 6 and then aged 9, saw Leonard Bernstein at work and made the decision that conducting would be her career. Much later she would go on to be mentored by the man who inspired her.\n\nIt bores her when interviewers ask why there aren\u0027t more women conductors - nonetheless her capacity to maximise the few opportunities she was given as a young woman making her way in an exclusively mans\u0027 world gives one a flavour of her indomitability. Her day-to-day job after all is working out how to convince 100 experts to do what she wants.\n\nShe says, \u0022maybe it\u0027s being an only child: you want to bring people together and create this big family feeling, I don\u0027t know what it is but I always gravitated towards organising.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-09-28T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Marin Alsop"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04hml41","title":"Steve McQueen","first_broadcast_date":"2014-09-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04k7b73","title":"Sally Wainwright","first_broadcast_date":"2014-10-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04jhm79","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnybx","duration":2262,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
