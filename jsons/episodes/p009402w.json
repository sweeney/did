Designer and knitter Kaffe Fassett will be talking to Sue Lawley about the inspiration for his extraordinary bold and simple designs which have brought him fame and fortune the world over, and also waxing lyrical over the colours and patterns he uses, which reflect Byzantine carpets, Roman glass or just simple fruit, vegetables and shells. He\u0027ll also be talking about his bohemian childhood in California and the route which turned him into an Anglophile and led him to an exhibition of his work at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Vespers by Claudio Monteverdi\nBook: Reflections by Hermann Hesse\nLuxury: Diary and pen","first_broadcast_date":"1990-07-01T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Kaffe Fassett"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009403p","title":"George Carman QC","first_broadcast_date":"1990-06-24T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094028","title":"Peter Jonas","first_broadcast_date":"1990-07-08T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009402x","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcpj","duration":2311,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
