Living by the sea, he took the obvious option and opened a fish restaurant. Today he is Britain\u0027s best sea food chef and a passionate advocate for the pleasures of cooking and eating fish. In conversation with Sue Lawley, he talks about his life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Concerto for Flute, Harp \u0026 Orchestra in C Major by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \nBook: Anna Karenina  by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: Thai fish sauce","first_broadcast_date":"1999-08-01T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rick Stein"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094215","title":"Rod Steiger","first_broadcast_date":"1999-07-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00941zv","title":"Patricia Routledge","first_broadcast_date":"1999-08-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009420j","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfp8","duration":2134,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
