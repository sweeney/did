Passionate about planting and growing flowers and herbs as a child in the 1930s, it wasn\u0027t until the 1950s, with her four children away at school, that she began a serious study of horticulture. Completely self-taught, she has gone on to develop a career designing some of Britain\u0027s most beautiful gardens and numbers Prince Charles and Elton John amongst her clients.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Papillons by Robert Schumann\nBook: A Celebration of Gardens by Sir Roy Strong\nLuxury: Waterproof pens, paper and folders","first_broadcast_date":"1994-02-13T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rosemary Verey"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qxj","title":"Douglas Adams","first_broadcast_date":"1994-02-06T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qw4","title":"Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke MP","first_broadcast_date":"1994-02-20T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qwx","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf2j","duration":2122,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
