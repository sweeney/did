Born just before Christmas in 1948 to a single mother he was brought up in poverty in first York and then London. He says that he learnt early on the importance of not running away from a challenge and his grandfather and step-father taught him how to face up to his own fears. \n\nHe went on to join the SAS through the territorial army and, during his career at Westminster, has earned the nicknames \u0027Bone Crusher\u0027 and \u0027Bovver Boy\u0027. Yet he shocked his own party when, in June last summer, he stood down as Shadow Home Secretary and announced he was going to campaign against what he saw as a fundamental assault by the government on our civil liberties. In this personal interview, he describes the anxieties that beset him as he made that decision - and the extent to which his political life changed as a result of it.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Un Bel Di - One Fine Day by Kiri Te Kanawa \nBook: The complete works by Iain Banks\nLuxury: A magic wine cellar which never runs out.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-16T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Davis MP"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00fbl6n","title":"Allan Ahlberg","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-14T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00fkbrf","title":"Janet Street-Porter","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00ffv1n","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzz4","duration":2194,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
