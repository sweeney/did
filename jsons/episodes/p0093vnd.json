As this year\u0027s Reith Lecturer on Radio 4 he described how he interprets and understands life through music. On Desert Island Discs he gives a personal insight into his own life and career. He was a child prodigy - the only son of musical parents, he gave his first piano recital at the age of seven and when he was 11 the legendary conductor Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler described him as \u0027a phenomenon\u0027. \n\nHis marriage to the British cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e8 made them the most celebrated musical couple of their day - but less than two years after they were married, she began to show symptoms of multiple sclerosis - the disease that would kill her. In a moving interview recorded in his home in Jerusalem, Daniel Barenboim talks frankly about their relationship and the cruelty of her illness; he reveals his own musical influences and also discusses his plans to spend more time playing the piano, after stepping down as Music Director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra later this year. \n\nHe would, Daniel says, only take musical scores to the island, and not records.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nBook: Ethics by Benedict Spinoza\nLuxury: A piano with a mattress","first_broadcast_date":"2006-05-07T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Daniel Barenboim"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vpc","title":"Terence Stamp","first_broadcast_date":"2006-03-12T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vmk","title":"Darcey Bussell","first_broadcast_date":"2006-05-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vng","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0c5","duration":2415,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
