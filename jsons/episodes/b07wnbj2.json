Her career as a reporter was forged in some of the world\u0027s most hostile environments from Bosnia to Rwanda and Iraq to Israel. From the early \u002790s onwards she was so ubiquitous on screen that her peers in the press pack coined the darkly comic phrase \u0022where there\u0027s a war, there\u0027s Amanpour.\u0022\n\nBorn to an Iranian father and a British mother, she initially wanted to be a doctor, but the Revolution in Iran in 1979 galvanised her political consciousness and she turned to journalism. Her first major assignment was in Saudi Arabia where she covered the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. She describes her time in Bosnia as a life-changing experience which made her determined to tell the stories of ordinary people caught up in the chaos of conflict.\n\nDuring her career she has interviewed some of the biggest names on the world stage from Bill Clinton and Tony Blair to Robert Mugabe and Colonel Gaddafi. The winner of 11 Emmy Awards, she now anchors her own nightly television show on CNN although she can be whisked away at a moment\u0027s notice to cover major disasters around the globe. She has borne witness to some of history\u0027s worst atrocities but what gets her through is her eternal optimism and the courage and dignity of humanity.\n\n\nProducer: Paula McGinley.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-10-02T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Christiane Amanpour"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07w5zs0","title":"Joyce DiDonato","first_broadcast_date":"2016-09-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07x1lhl","title":"Stephen Hough","first_broadcast_date":"2016-10-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b07wnb0x","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p049k78g","duration":2011,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
