For a decade he was the second most important prelate in the Church of England but, earlier this year, he handed in his notice to return to life as a parish priest. \n\nAs a young boy growing up in Wakefield, it was his cousin Muriel who would take him along to the town\u0027s cathedral to worship - he was captivated by the ritual and atmosphere of the place and 35 years later he returned as its Bishop. A traditionalist himself, he opposed the ordination of women and believes the church should resist pressure to ordain practising homosexuals, but he fears that both issues will continue to divide Anglicans across the world for the rest of his lifetime. He says he has never been happier than he is as a parish priest - and that throughout his ministry, he has been someone who preferred people to paper.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Vespers by Sergei Rachmaninov\nBook: Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: A case of selected malt whiskies","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-11T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Hope"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009359k","title":"Colin Firth","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009385k","title":"Maggi Hambling","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009359d","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0d5","duration":2289,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
