Now a distinguished Professor of Neurology, he was immortalised by Robin Williams in the film Awakenings. Inspired by Dr Sacks\u0027 book of the same name, it tells the story of the summer of 1969, when the catatonic patients he was treating at the time responded to an apparent miracle drug and came alive. He\u0027ll be talking about the excitements and disappointments of that summer and also about some of the 100s of extraordinary case histories which have formed the basis of his many other books. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Chu Chin Chow Here Be Oysters by Martin Lawrence\nBook: Dictionary of Musical Themes\nLuxury: Scuba diving kit","first_broadcast_date":"1994-01-02T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Oliver Sacks"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093wlr","title":"Lord Ashley","first_broadcast_date":"1993-12-26T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093r0y","title":"Ian Hislop","first_broadcast_date":"1994-01-09T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093r1p","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf3g","duration":2281,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
