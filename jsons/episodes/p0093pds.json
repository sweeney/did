He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the responsibilities and pleasures of being one of the country\u0027s richest men.

The comparatively early death of his father then meant that by the time he was just 19 he was managing one of Britain\u0027s greatest estates, and by 27 he owned it. He\u0027ll be discussing the pleasures and the perils of his position, why he is no longer a member of the Conservative Party and his hopes and dreams for his four-year-old son and heir, Hugh.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Albatross by Fleetwood Mac\nBook: Through Russian Snows by G A Henty\nLuxury: Telescope","first_broadcast_date":"1995-07-02T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Duke Of Westminster"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pff","title":"Jasper Conran","first_broadcast_date":"1995-06-25T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pcv","title":"Wendy Richard","first_broadcast_date":"1995-07-09T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pdv","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdvl","duration":2147,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
