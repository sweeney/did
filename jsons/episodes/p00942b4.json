In 1945, at the age of 20, she travelled to Belsen with the Jewish Relief agency. There she learnt how important it is to listen to those who have suffered. It was a lesson she continued to practice in her work with Amnesty International, and later with the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture which she set up in 1985. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Song of the Birds by Cant Del Ocells\nBook: Poet for Poet  by Richard McCain\nLuxury: Radio to listen to the World Service","first_broadcast_date":"1999-05-02T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Helen Bamber"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00942bx","title":"Stan Tracey","first_broadcast_date":"1999-04-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009429m","title":"Richard Dreyfuss","first_broadcast_date":"1999-05-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00942b5","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfq9","duration":2256,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
