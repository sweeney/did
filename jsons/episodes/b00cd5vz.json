He\u0027s been hailed as perhaps the best Italian cook in Britain today and the flavours and methods he holds dear are the ones he learnt at his mother\u0027s knee, growing up in Northern Italy. The food he ate then was high quality, locally produced and carefully prepared - now, that\u0027s every chefs mantra, but when he arrived in Britain in the 1970s it was ground-breaking. Within a few years he\u0027d taken over the Neal Street Restaurant in London\u0027s Covent Garden and turned it into an institution and now his highly successful cafes are scattered throughout Britain.\n\nFor him preparing and cooking food is a sensual act, so perhaps it\u0027s no surprise that in his spare time he whittles wood into intricately-patterned walking sticks and tries his hand at clay modelling too. It\u0027s all part of a life that, at its best, is a tactile, sensual experience.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Finale to The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns\nBook: His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman\nLuxury: White truffles.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-06T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Antonio Carluccio"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00c7kkr","title":"Posy Simmonds","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00chbtj","title":"Felicity Lott","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00cd5qg","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp00c","duration":2127,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
