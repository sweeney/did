He enjoyed reading, being outdoors and acting in school plays. He remembers attending church every day in Holy week, getting involved cleaning out the store rooms and making a bonfire of the rubbish. In his later teenage years he was inspired by the excellent choir, youth activities and Canon Eddie Hughes, vicar of All Saints, Oystermouth. Rowan went to Cambridge to study theology and for a time he was torn between Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism. He decided on the latter and soon after, when he was 28 years old, he was ordained as a priest. He spent the next few years lecturing and working with students and the local community. He became professor of Divinity at Oxford University. \n\nHe left academic work to take up the post of Bishop of Monmouth in 1991 and in 1999 he was elected Archbishop of Wales. Rowan was officially confirmed on 2nd December as the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury. He is also a philosopher, a poet, and a linguist who speaks seven languages. He has written a number of books on the history of theology and spirituality and published collections of articles and sermons as well as two books of poetry. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Opening of Solo Cello Suite 1 in G Major by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Collection of poems by W H Auden\nLuxury: A piano","first_broadcast_date":"2002-12-22T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rowan Williams"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947fr","title":"Sinead Cusack","first_broadcast_date":"2002-12-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947f5","title":"Patricia Cornwell","first_broadcast_date":"2002-12-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00947fd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz86","duration":2246,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
