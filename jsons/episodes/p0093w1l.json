Most recently, he won three Best Actor awards for playing the English master in Alan Bennett\u0027s play \u0027The History Boys\u0027 but he has cross-generational appeal - perpetual adolescents revere his performance as gay Uncle Monty in the film Withnail and I while the younger generation know him as beastly Uncle Vernon from the Harry Potter films. \n\nHe\u0027s had to work hard for his achievements: both his parents were profoundly deaf and, from a young age, he was their ears and their translator. He studied drama against his father\u0027s wishes - he had hoped his son would go to art college. However, he says his father was an expert in reading body language and he learned from him how people\u0027s physical behaviour reveals their inner thoughts. He is currently in the West End in Tom Stoppard\u0027s play Heroes; he\u0027s working on a film version of The History Boys, directed by Nicholas Hytner and is preparing to tour with The History Boys around the world.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Tr\u00e4umerei by Vladimir Horowitz\nBook: Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray\nLuxury: Velasquez\u0027s Las Meninas","first_broadcast_date":"2006-01-08T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Richard Griffiths"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093w2b","title":"Kelly Holmes","first_broadcast_date":"2006-01-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093w0q","title":"Frankie Dettori","first_broadcast_date":"2006-01-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093w1m","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0cx","duration":2111,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
