She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her musical Yorkshire family - both her grandfathers were musical entertainers - and how she learnt to read music before she could read books. Having won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, she moved straight into performing and was snapped up by the English National Opera. She\u0027ll be discussing her favourite roles and her passionate belief that opera should lose its elitist image.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Broadway Babe\nBook: Photograph album\nLuxury: Tightrope","first_broadcast_date":"1993-10-10T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lesley Garrett"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093wq6","title":"Rt Hon Virginia Bottomley MP","first_broadcast_date":"1993-10-03T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093wpp","title":"Raymond Seitz","first_broadcast_date":"1993-10-17T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093wpz","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf4y","duration":2276,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
