He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about how he came to Britain from Toronto as an Intelligence Officer during the Second World War, after which he wrote a book called Defeat in the West, which was based on interviews he conducted with defeated German officers. It was this book which brought him to the attention of Lord Beaverbrook, leading to his promotion from humble diarist on the London Evening Standard to its film critic. He then went on to become the paper\u0027s chief theatre critic - a job he did for 38 years, during which time he reckons to have been to 5,500 first nights, but, to his mind, no great plays.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Capriccio Italien by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nBook: The Cookery Book by Constance Spry\nLuxury: Tennis racket and ball machine","first_broadcast_date":"1994-06-05T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Milton Shulman"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qjy","title":"Peter Scudamore","first_broadcast_date":"1994-05-29T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qhc","title":"Zoe Wanamaker","first_broadcast_date":"1994-06-12T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qjf","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf12","duration":2274,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
