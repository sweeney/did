It was, she says, the first time she realised that wine was an intellectual experience and not just for lubrication. A familiar face on television for her Matters of Taste and Wine Course series, she also edited the prestigious Oxford Companion to Wine. But her main occupation is tasting, and she can sip and spit more than a hundred varieties at a sitting. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Sabat Mater Inflammatus Et Accensus by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi\nBook: Middlemarch by George Eliot\nLuxury: Cellar of wines and a corkscrew","first_broadcast_date":"1996-10-27T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jancis Robinson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n6w","title":"Jackie Charlton","first_broadcast_date":"1996-10-20T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093n69","title":"Chris Patten","first_broadcast_date":"1996-11-03T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093n6l","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdmn","duration":2325,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
