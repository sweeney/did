When she joined Sadlers Wells at 14 she quickly took on leading roles and became Britain\u0027s first \u0027Baby Ballerina\u0027. In the late 1950s she left the Royal Ballet to pursue a glittering freelance career - becoming the first Western ballerina to perform at the Bolshoi. In conversation with Sue Lawley, she talks about her life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Beginning of the Third Movement by Jean Sibelius\nBook: This Sceptred Isle  by Christopher Lee\nLuxury: Box of watercolour paints","first_broadcast_date":"2002-03-10T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dame Beryl Grey"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094812","title":"Lord May","first_broadcast_date":"2002-03-03T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947zh","title":"Fay Godwin","first_broadcast_date":"2002-03-17T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094808","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzdn","duration":2193,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
