Mary Stott became Women\u0027s Editor of the Guardian newspaper in 1957 and under her editorship, the women\u0027s pages were transformed. Her commissioning of many distinguished writers as well as her encouragement to her readers themselves to write first-hand accounts of their experiences led to the foundation of many important women\u0027s organisations. Now 87, she\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her enduring support of feminist issues, her memories of the suffragette movement and her love of singing.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: St John\u0027s Passion Rest Calm, Oh Body Pure And Holy by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: The Act of Creation by Arthur Koestler\nLuxury: Watercolours for painting","first_broadcast_date":"1994-09-25T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Mary Stott"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qbb","title":"John Tavener","first_broadcast_date":"1994-09-18T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093q8s","title":"Professor James Fenton","first_broadcast_date":"1994-10-02T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093q9l","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf0b","duration":2270,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
