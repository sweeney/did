Lauded for his hugely inventive stand up, he has carved out a highly successful career with an altogether atypical approach. He\u0027s a familiar face on television from his regular appearances on quiz shows Have I Got News for You, QI and Never Mind the Buzzcocks.\n\nAt school he was a gifted pupil who gave up on his education and a pitch-perfect piano student who flunked his music school entrance. He started drifting as a teenager and gave up on university within days of arrival - he says he was looking for the next challenge, and that turned out to be stand-up comedy. He loved having to think on his feet and found the laughter of strangers intoxicating.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Once in a Lifetime by Talking Heads\nBook: The collected works by W. Somerset Maugham\nLuxury: A pack of cards.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-08T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Bill Bailey"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00bvbzm","title":"Lord Woolf","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-01T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00c1q5q","title":"Peter Carey","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-20T09:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00by9xz","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp00y","duration":1946,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
