Nearly five years later, courageous and resilient, he emerged from a captivity of appalling deprivation and isolation. This week on Desert Island Discs he will be talking to Sue Lawley about those years and recalling the three vows he took - no regrets, no self-pity, no sentimentality - which he believes saved his sanity.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Sleep by Benjamin Luxon\nBook: Complete Cambridge Histories\nLuxury: Chess computer","first_broadcast_date":"1992-06-21T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Terry Waite"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093xwy","title":"Robert Lindsay","first_broadcast_date":"1992-06-14T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093xv2","title":"Vivienne Westwood","first_broadcast_date":"1992-06-28T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093xw4","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfc0","duration":2363,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
