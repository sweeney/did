Since then it\u0027s made her a household name and she may be moments away from becoming a \u0027national treasure\u0027. \n\nDouble act partner, sit-com star, sketch show performer, writer, actor, Dawn has made us laugh for years. So does she ever feel overwhelmed by people\u0027s expectations? She says \u0022I tell myself that I\u0027m the sort of person who can open a one-woman play in the West End, so I do .... I am the sort of person who writes a book - so I do\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dawn French"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01p9g3w","title":"Sister Wendy Beckett","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01ph5b5","title":"Anya Hindmarch","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01pf64m","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnymg","duration":2112,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
