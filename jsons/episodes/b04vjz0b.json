But his work has more range and nuance, encompassing roles as varied as Henry VIII, Magwich in Great Expectations and the lead in Beowulf.\n\nBeyond the screen the man himself almost seems to come from a bygone era, when a fellow worth his salt always wore a dapper three piece suit and was handy with his fists. In his youth as a boxer he won 80 of his 88 fights and it seemed for a while that a whiff of menace had followed him out of the ring and onto the streets.\n\nHowever he says, \u0022I\u0027m not like the geezers I play: loads of things scare me in everyday life but you have to hide a bit and put on a front. I cry at movies, I cry at scripts, I cried when West Ham got back into the Premiership - I\u0027m even frightened of spiders.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-28T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ray Winstone"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04vd69f","title":"The Most Reverend Justin Welby","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04wrwmd","title":"Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04vjyvb","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny9g","duration":1997,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
