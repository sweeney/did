She had no formal scientific qualifications when she first went to Africa to study the Gombe chimpanzees. But it was this lack of preconceptions which made her so successful as a naturalist. Watching chimps use sticks to extract termites from their mounds she realised that she was about to smash the assumption that only humans used tools. Now, forty years after she first stepped into the bush, she describes how she has halted her patient study of the chimpanzees to fight for their survival.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Under the Milk Wood by Richard Burton\nBook: The Lord of the Rings by J R R Tolkien\nLuxury: Pencil and paper","first_broadcast_date":"2000-01-09T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dr Jane Goodall"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00941nd","title":"Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber","first_broadcast_date":"1999-12-31T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b9p","title":"Ian McEwan","first_broadcast_date":"2000-01-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094bbl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzq3","duration":2246,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
