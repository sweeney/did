Since then she\u0027s been responsible for ground-breaking advances in cardiovascular treatment and founded the World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology.\n\nShe had something of a role model in her mother, a hard-working, clever, successful woman too. Her early years as a pupil at a boys\u0027 school in Wales must also have prepared her for making her way in such a heavily male-dominated profession.\n\nShe has a reputation for being straight-talking, and her late husband used to urge her to be more \u0022prudent\u0022, but, she says, \u0022it wasn\u0027t fun to be prudent: it was much more fun to be mafioso and naughty.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-07T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jane Somerville"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0366xsb","title":"Steven Pinker","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b036tqpl","title":"Val McDermid","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b036j967","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyjx","duration":2177,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
