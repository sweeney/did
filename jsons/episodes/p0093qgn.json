He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about how he did not go to school until he was 11, hated it when he got there, but managed, much against the wishes of the school, to teach himself history of art. He\u0027ll also be describing how he felt when his friend and mentor, Sir Anthony Blunt, the Keeper of the Queen\u0027s Pictures, was denounced as a spy in 1979. Sewell was thrust into the public eye as Blunt\u0027s protector. He\u0027s been there ever since - attacking what he regards as the excesses of contemporary art, and attracting much criticism himself as a result of his attitudes.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Fidelio Aria - \u0027Komm Hoffnung\u0027 by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: Songs from the 1880s with piano accompaniment by Franz Schubert\nLuxury: Pieta sculpture by Michelangelo","first_broadcast_date":"1994-06-19T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Brian Sewell"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qhc","title":"Zoe Wanamaker","first_broadcast_date":"1994-06-12T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qfw","title":"John Drummond","first_broadcast_date":"1994-06-26T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qgs","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf0w","duration":2215,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
