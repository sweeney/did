She\u0027s most easily recognised as Sybil Fawlty, wife of John Cleese, the manic hotelkeeper in the television series Fawlty Towers, but it\u0027s a role which represents a very small part of all she\u0027s done. Since her debut in Bristol 40 years ago, she has never been out of work, and recently she\u0027s scaled new heights with her portrayal of the Queen in Alan Bennett\u0027s A Question of Attribution. She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about the problems associated with playing such a well-known and much-loved figure, and also about the rest of her long and successful career.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Ruht Wohl Ihr Heiligen Gebeine by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Complete works in German by William Shakespeare and The Bible in Russian and a Russian dictionary\nLuxury: A huge tapestry kit","first_broadcast_date":"1992-05-31T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Prunella Scales"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093xzl","title":"Lord Chief Justice Taylor","first_broadcast_date":"1992-05-24T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093xxy","title":"Duncan Goodhew","first_broadcast_date":"1992-06-07T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093xyz","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfcf","duration":2275,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
