It may seem an odd way to spend one\u0027s life but it\u0027s his way.\n\nOne of the world\u0027s elite climbers he\u0027s credited with a long list of first time ascents. He\u0027s also summited Everest three times. During one renowned climb he discovered the icy corpse of the legendary George Mallory who had perished along with Sandy Irvine as they tried to scale the peak - in nothing more than hobnail boots and tweeds - in 1924.\n\nWhen he isn\u0027t exploring the far corners of the world\u0027s wilderness he\u0027s at home in Montana with his wife Jennifer, the widow of his best friend Alex Lowe, who was killed by an avalanche that narrowly missed Conrad himself.\n\nHe says of his life, \u0022Most people are so risk averse. The world is full of couch potatoes ... we climbers should get government stipends for keeping the risk-taking gene pool alive.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-09T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Conrad Anker"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b02116z9","title":"Sir Mervyn King","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-02T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b02x5j67","title":"Alexandra Shulman","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-16T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b02lqmlf","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyk8","duration":2047,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
