He was recently voted the most powerful man in comedy with four Baftas and an international Emmy under his belt. He\u0027s been on screen recently with his weekly show from New York but he\u0027s better known to British audiences for his So Graham Norton, as well as the annoying Father Noel in the series Father Ted. After six years with Channel 4 he\u0027s been poached by the BBC to front a Saturday night light entertainment show. He\u0027s compared the two channels to the difference between a night out with your friends or a family Christmas lunch and media critics have pondered how his camp brand of adult humour will translate to mainstream TV. \n\nOriginally born Graham Walker in Dublin in 1963, he was brought up in the small town of Bandon in West Cork. As a child he loved television describing it as a \u0027window to life\u0027 and a world he wanted to be part of. He began an English and French degree at University College Cork but dropped out after his first year and went to America where he lived in a hippy commune in San Francisco. He eventually returned and enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London with the ambition of becoming an actor. He changed his name to Norton - as the actor\u0027s union Equity infomed him they already had another Graham Walker on their books. He moved to Channel 4 in 1998 and moves to the BBC on his return from the States later this year.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Islands in the Stream\nBook: Mansfield Park by Jane Austen\nLuxury: Mirror","first_broadcast_date":"2004-05-02T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Graham Norton"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936m4","title":"Antonio Pappano","first_broadcast_date":"2004-04-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938f0","title":"U A Fanthorpe","first_broadcast_date":"2004-05-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936lg","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz2p","duration":2026,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
