His opinions have provoked, offended and enraged plenty of people over the years and sweeping works about modernity, morality, art and philosophy, sit alongside fiercely opinionated biographies and essays. He says: \u0022I like to be, in general, in agreement with what most people think, but I also like to be a little bit independent and individual and, thank God, I\u0027ve been allowed to do that all my writing life.\u0022\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Paul Johnson"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01946pk","title":"Dame Monica Mason","first_broadcast_date":"2012-01-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b019rd99","title":"Vikram Seth","first_broadcast_date":"2012-01-22T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b019f26c","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnys4","duration":2178,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
