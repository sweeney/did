At the height of the Cold War, he swapped a post in America for a place at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow, where he partied with the Bolshoi and was interrogated by the KGB. He is also Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at Imperial College, but, despite his eminence, he admits his students had a \u0027professor button\u0027 fitted onto their hi-tech lasers. It was, he explains, a knob he could twiddle while showing visitors around the lab, but it wasn\u0027t connected to the machinery and meant he didn\u0027t ruin his students\u0027 experiments. \n\nRecord: The Marriage of Figaro \nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy \nLuxury: A piano with music \n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2011-05-01T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Prof David Phillips"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b010lyy4","title":"Cath Kidston","first_broadcast_date":"2011-04-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b010xy3d","title":"Molly Parkin","first_broadcast_date":"2011-05-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b010t2c9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnpdr","duration":2321,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
