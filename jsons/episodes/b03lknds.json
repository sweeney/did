She writes about everything from dinosaurs to suicide, but the potency and power of nature is a recurring motif.\n\nAlthough she\u0027s recognised for her significant and distinguished contribution to her homeland\u0027s literature and culture, her verse has been translated into ten languages and she regularly receives fan mail from South America, Pakistan and most countries in between.\n\nAside from writing, her main project in life is the conservation of her own small patch of West Wales - restoring hedges, conserving bluebells and tending sheep take up her spare time.\n\nShe says, \u0022A poem is the only work of art you can have for nothing. Read it, memorise it, copy it into your notebook and it\u0027s yours.\u0022\n\nProducer: Paula McGinley.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-15T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gillian Clarke"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03kpkyj","title":"Barbara Hulanicki","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03m3nhk","title":"Miranda Hart","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-22T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03lkncr","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnygd","duration":2154,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
