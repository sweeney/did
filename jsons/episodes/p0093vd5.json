Three years ago Monty Don became the nation\u0027s most high-profile gardener when he took over from Alan Titchmarsh as the lead presenter of Gardener\u0027s World. Entirely self-taught, he has been gardening since he was a child - but it was not until he was in his late thirties that he found he could make his great passion become his vocation. \n\nHis first career ended disastrously; he and his wife Sarah set up a jewellery business together and during the 1980s they prospered; they had shops and offices in Knightsbridge and counted singers and film stars among their clients. But when the slump came they lost everything - the business, their jobs and their home. \n\nonty suffered years of depression that left him barely able to function. It was by chance that he was offered some stints presenting gardening slots on television. He never looked back - he says there hasn\u0027t been a day since when he\u0027s not been working and he\u0027s become a successful gardening columnist, broadcaster and author.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: A Hard Day\u0027s Night by The Beatles\nBook: Collected Poems of Henry Vaughan \nLuxury: Hendrickje Bathing by Rembrandt","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-09T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Monty Don"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vdv","title":"Lord Browne","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-02T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vcc","title":"Ian Rankin","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-16T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vd6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0b5","duration":2142,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
