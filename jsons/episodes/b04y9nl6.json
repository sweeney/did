A phone call from her and many of the big beasts of the business world - the \u0022pinstripes\u0022 she calls them - stride from their boardrooms intent on giving something back to society. Her energies and endeavours have powered countless corporate social responsibility programmes.\n\nIn a life dedicated to public service, she has charmed not only chief executives but apparently royalty too - HRH the Prince of Wales is a long time supporter and collaborator.\n\nShe seems keenly aware that not everyone has her good fortune of a first class education and top drawer connections - when she\u0027s not harrying the blue chip brigade, she\u0027s inspiring young people from all sorts of backgrounds to follow her example and get involved in social action.\n\nShe says, \u0022one of the most important leadership roles is to grow people. It is very much like gardening. You tend them and apply fertiliser. But sometimes you have to prune them to make them grow stronger.\u0022\n\nProducer: Paula McGinley.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-18T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Julia Cleverdon"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04xmqd6","title":"Jo Malone","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0505l3c","title":"Professor Peter Piot","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04y9ncd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny8z","duration":2154,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
