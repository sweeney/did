Some of her novels have been adapted for the screen. She has also published three volumes of journalism.\n\nMarian was born the eldest of five children in Ireland in 1963. While she was academically successful at school, she says she wasn\u0027t taught to think for herself, which left her ill prepared for university where she studied law.\n\nAfter completing her degree, but failing to get apprenticed to a law firm in Dublin, she moved to London. She spent her twenties working as a waitress, and began drinking heavily. She went into rehab for her alcoholism when she was 30. \n\nHer fortunes changed once she was sober: she sent some short stories she had written the previous year off to a publisher and had her debut novel published in 1995. \n\nMarian has described each of her books as \u0022a comedy about something serious\u0022 and says they are a reflection of who she is:\n\u0022I\u0027m very bleak, really melancholic. But I\u0027ve always used humour as a survival mechanism. I write for me and I need to feel hopeful about the human condition. So no way I\u0027m going to write a downbeat ending. And it isn\u0027t entirely ludicrous to suggest that sometimes things might work out for the best.\u0022\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-03-12T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Marian Keyes"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b08gwk5g","title":"Jimmy Carr","first_broadcast_date":"2017-03-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b08j9h6g","title":"Amanda Levete","first_broadcast_date":"2017-03-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b08hl8t6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p04wb4gv","duration":2062,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
