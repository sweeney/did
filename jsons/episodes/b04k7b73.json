Her ear for dialogue and talent for story-telling place her among the cream of small screen dramatists: she majors in whip-smart phrasing and plot lines that twist the innards with their tension, but never strain plausibility.\n\nHer passion for every day drama was honed at her mother\u0027s knee: in the 60\u0027s and 70\u0027s as Mrs. Wainwright watched Coronation Street, young Sally tuned in too, developing an affinity with the power of the portrayal of language as it is spoken and life as it is lived. She would later go on to write for the show.\n\nShe says, \u0022When I was seven I started writing down the things people said - it was something I just had to do. I think I was born with it - it\u0027s like being able to draw or paint.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-10-05T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sally Wainwright"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04jhmhf","title":"Marin Alsop","first_broadcast_date":"2014-09-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04l065b","title":"Sir Roy Strong","first_broadcast_date":"2014-10-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04k7b17","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnybv","duration":2199,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
