For many years he brought farce to a large and appreciative audience - dropping his trousers thousands of times for the benefit of television viewers and theatre-goers. He was one of the most successful actor-managers that Britain has produced. But, more than 30 years ago, he called a halt to his first career to devote himself to altering legislation and attitudes towards disability. His eldest child, Shelley, was born with Down\u0027s syndrome and her birth prompted him towards his extraordinary second career. As a campaigner and fundraiser he has been described as having done more for people with learning disabilities than possibly anyone else in the country.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Love by Nat King Cole\nBook: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\nLuxury: A proper orthopaedic cushion.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-01T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Rix"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00hmpbz","title":"David Walliams","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-22T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00hy5yh","title":"Richard Madeley","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00hrt7m","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzxs","duration":2034,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
