He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his early poverty-stricken years in an East End foster home and his discovery, at the age of eight, that one of the girls in the home he had thought of as his older sister was, in fact, his mother. He\u0027ll also be describing how an aptitude for reading and writing, the encouragement of a concerned teacher and his own determination led him into journalism, where he started his career as an outdoor messenger at Reuters. From there, he went on to edit three Fleet Street newspapers and more recently, to become a popular radio personality.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Tosca Aria - E Lucevan Le Stelle by Giacomo Puccini\nBook: The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck\nLuxury: Word processor","first_broadcast_date":"1994-07-03T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Derek Jameson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qfw","title":"John Drummond","first_broadcast_date":"1994-06-26T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qd5","title":"Rabbi Hugo Gryn","first_broadcast_date":"1994-07-10T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qf5","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf0n","duration":2173,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
