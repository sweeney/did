It\u0027s 20 years since he opened the first edition of ITV\u0027s This Morning programme with his wife Judy Finnigan and, in the years since, pretty well everyone has sat on their sofa, from Madonna to Tony Blair, from the Clintons to, notoriously, OJ Simpson. Today, Richard Madeley is the epitome of a certain kind of smooth charm. In this frank interview though, he describes how he wasn\u0027t always so confident: he used to be so anxious about holding a conversation with his colleagues that he\u0027d make excuses to hide himself away. He was in his 20s when he decided to become, he says, embarrassingly frank. He recognised how both his father and grandfather had deliberately stifled their own emotions and decided that he would be healthier and happier giving voice to them.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Summertime by Ella Fitzgerald\nBook: Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Suzanna Clarke\nLuxury: Guitar.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-08T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Richard Madeley"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00hrt91","title":"Lord Rix","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00j26xw","title":"Baaba Maal","first_broadcast_date":"2009-03-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00hy5l6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzxp","duration":2131,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
