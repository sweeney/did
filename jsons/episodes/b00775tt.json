His specialism is the care of elderly patients - it\u0027s an area that he combines with his philosophical interest in considering what it is that makes humans unique - all part, as he says, of \u0027unpacking the miracle of everyday life\u0027.\n\nHe was one of five children brought up in modest circumstances in Liverpool. A bright child, he studied at Oxford and then St Thomas\u0027 Hospital although he acknowledges that his father was always disappointed that he had become a doctor - thinking it rather a shabby profession compared to his own preference for mathematics. Throughout much of his working life he rose before dawn in order to squeeze in time for his writing before he started his clinical work and in 2000 he was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in recognition of his contribution to medical research.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The first movement of String Quintet in C Major by Franz Schubert\nBook: Being and Time by Martin Heidegger\nLuxury: A video of a day in the life of his family.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-03-25T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Raymond Tallis"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00775jk","title":"Jo Brand","first_broadcast_date":"2007-03-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007763z","title":"Ben Helfgott","first_broadcast_date":"2007-04-01T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00700v6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp06q","duration":2219,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
