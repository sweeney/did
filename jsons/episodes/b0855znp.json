He grew up in New Jersey where the Catholic church played a central role in his early life. The family teetered on the brink of poverty, and his first guitar was rented, rather than bought. He spent his apprentice years as a musician and singer with local bands before landing a record deal in 1972. When \u0027Born to Run\u0027 was released in 1975 it turned him into a household name. His first Top Ten single was \u0027Hungry Heart\u0027, ahead of his most successful album \u0027Born in the USA\u0027 which was released in 1984.\n\nIn spite of having long transcended the environment he grew up in, Springsteen has remained a chronicler of blue-collar lives. His records are frequently a political commentary on the struggles of ordinary Americans. In the Nineties he settled into family life with his wife Patti Scialfa who sings with his E Street Band. \n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-12-18T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Bruce Springsteen"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b084tjzt","title":"Davina McCall","first_broadcast_date":"2016-12-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b085pxy6","title":"Gareth Malone","first_broadcast_date":"2016-12-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0855z1d","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"b086vbpv","duration":900,"types":["Shortened"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p04lhx5p","duration":2917,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p04lnf91","duration":3600,"types":["Editorial"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
