A criminologist and author, he\u0027s director of the Childhood, Transition and Social Justice Initiative and was lead researcher of the Hillsborough Independent Panel. \n\nBorn into a working class family in Wallasey in the Wirral in 1949, he attended a seminary at the age of 12. Deciding the religious life was not for him he worked as a bus conductor before attending Liverpool University where he read Sociology. \n\nHis early work with Travellers and Liverpool\u0027s black community led to an interest in deaths in custody and prison conditions. Then, following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 he would spend the next 28 years researching and writing about the disaster - his book Hillsborough: The Truth was first published in 1999. The Hillsborough Independent Panel\u0027s 2012 report led to a second inquest which concluded in April 2016 that the 96 people who died had been unlawfully killed and that fans behaviour had not contributed to the disaster in any way. \n\nPhil and his partner, Deena, have lived in Belfast since 2003. He has two grown-up sons from his first marriage.\n\nPresenter: Kirsty Young\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-11-05T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Phil Scraton"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b09bxmyb","title":"Kay Mellor","first_broadcast_date":"2017-10-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b09f380g","title":"Anna Pavord","first_broadcast_date":"2017-11-17T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b09cvygd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p05lxmsj","duration":2080,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
