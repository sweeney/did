Now in her 92nd year, Anne Scott-James came from a line of critics and writers and became one of the first women career journalists, editors and columnists, before embarking on a second career as the author of a series of gardening books. \n \nAfter Oxford she joined Vogue - first as an assistant to a secretary and then went from writing the odd picture caption to proper articles. She became editor of Harper\u0027s Bazaar - and during her magazine career she commissioned work from such figures as Cecil Beaton, John Betjemen and Elizabeth David. Her marriage to Macdonald Hastings collapsed and in the early 60s she met the writer and illustrator Sir Osbert Lancaster and they married in 1967. At around the same time she embarked on a new stage in her career - gardening writing. Her first book, Down to Earth, and The Pleasure Garden, which she produced jointly with Sir Osbert, are now being republished as gardening classics.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Double Concerto for Two Violins in D by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Semi-attached Couple by Emily Eden\nLuxury: Nightdress made of pure white cotton","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-10T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Anne Scott James"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009389j","title":"Desmond Morris","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936dd","title":"Rt Hon Sir Menzies Campbell MP","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009388x","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz1p","duration":2251,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
