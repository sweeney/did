If algebraic topology and open hypermedia systems really aren\u0027t your thing, Dame Wendy is also in demand as a brilliant communicator on, what can seem to outsiders to be, impenetrable topics.\n\nHer parents were from humble beginnings and it was clear from the get-go that their first born had a budding flair for numbers: aged six she was charged with teaching a group of schoolmates maths. The first in her family to go to University she rejected Cambridge, judging it \u0022too stuffy\u0022.\n\nShe says, \u0022I get too excited about stuff. I love my life and am passionate about web science, women in science and shopping\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-07-27T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dame Wendy Hall"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b049xtjk","title":"Doug Allan","first_broadcast_date":"2014-07-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04c9xcg","title":"Guy Garvey","first_broadcast_date":"2014-08-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04bmddb","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnycb","duration":2071,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
