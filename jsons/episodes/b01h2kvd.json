He wrote the songs for the Royal Shakespeare Company\u0027s musical Matilda - the production of Roald Dahl\u0027s children\u0027s story has been a smash hit on the West End, won seven Olivier awards and is due to transfer to Broadway next year. \n\nHe says: \u0022I\u0027m not a magical thinker - I don\u0027t think I need my special undies on or my special pencil - I\u0027m not superstitious about the process. I just took my childhood of reading Dahl and said, \u0027I know what this is\u0027 and wrote some songs.\u0022 \n\nProducer: Isabel Sargent.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-05-06T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Tim Minchin"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01dtg1r","title":"Jamie Cullum","first_broadcast_date":"2012-03-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01hdqmd","title":"Baroness Hollins","first_broadcast_date":"2012-05-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01h2hv6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyqn","duration":2095,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
