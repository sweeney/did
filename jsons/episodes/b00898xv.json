She has recently stepped down as Britain\u0027s top spy-master - or more correctly, the Director-General of MI5. She took the helm in the months after the attacks of 11th September 2001 in America and steered the service through a time when the nature of the terrorist threat facing Britain changed enormously and new measures were introduced to counteract it.\n\nShe concedes that MI5 has to rely, in large part, on information that is \u0027patchy and incomplete\u0027 and that ultimately the service will always be judged \u0027by what we do not know and did not prevent\u0027. In her first ever interview, Dame Eliza talks gives her recollections about the day when Britain was targeted by suicide bombers, describes what lay behind her own departure from the service and reveals how her mother\u0027s role during World War II fuelled her own interest in public service.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The opening of String Quintet in C by Franz Schubert\nBook: The Rattlebag: An Anthology of Poetry by Ted Hughes\nLuxury: Large supply of pencils and pens.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-18T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Eliza Manningham-Buller"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0088vmz","title":"Jung Chang","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-16T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008chj2","title":"Armistead Maupin","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00898qc","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp03x","duration":2229,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
