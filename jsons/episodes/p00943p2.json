He is most famous as Wotan - ruler of the gods in Wagner\u0027s Ring Cycle. In fact, it\u0027s a role he has made so much his own that the composer\u0027s grandson says it could almost have been written with him in mind. Growing up in a Methodist family music was a natural part of life, yet he studied to be an engineer until the urge to sing became too powerful to ignore.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Concerto For Violin And Strings In D Minor Largo by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Flora and Fauna of a Tropical Desert Island\nLuxury: A box of lenses","first_broadcast_date":"1998-01-18T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Tomlinson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943pt","title":"Paul Hogarth","first_broadcast_date":"1998-01-11T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943nb","title":"Helena Kennedy QC","first_broadcast_date":"1998-01-25T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943p3","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfwv","duration":2206,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
