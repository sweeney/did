For millions of children, Christmas would be incomplete without Briggs\u0027s story The Snowman, which has been shown on television every year since its first release, in 1982, and his enduringly popular Father Christmas. \n\nRaymond was born in 1934 in Wimbledon. His mother, Ethel, was a lady\u0027s maid and his father, Ernest, a milkman. He wanted to draw cartoon strips from an early age but, at art school, found his tutors looked down on his aspirations. After leaving, he quickly secured work as a commercial artist, doing illustrations for advertisements, journals and books. He said he was so appalled at the standard of the children\u0027s books he was asked to illustrate he thought he could do better himself. And he did - his first attempt was immediately accepted for publication and he went on to twice win the Kate Greenaway Medal - the principal award for illustration.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Parce Mihi Domine (from Officium Defunctorum) by Christobal de Morales\nBook: Complete Works of Beachcomber by J B Morton\nLuxury: A full-size billiard table with Radio 4 built into each of the legs","first_broadcast_date":"2005-03-20T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Raymond Briggs"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935z5","title":"Stephen Poliakoff","first_broadcast_date":"2005-03-13T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935xc","title":"Yvonne Brewster","first_broadcast_date":"2005-03-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935ym","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0gc","duration":2215,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
