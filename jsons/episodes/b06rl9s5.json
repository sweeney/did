At 17, Kylie landed the role of Charlene Mitchell in the soap opera Neighbours and her on-screen wedding to Jason Donovan\u0027s character Scott Robinson was watched by twenty million people in the UK alone. \n\nHer recording career began after she was spotted singing at a charity event in 1987. Within months she had released a cover version of \u0022Locomotion\u0022 which became the biggest-selling Australian single of the decade. Following the single\u0027s success, her first hit with record producers Stock, Aitken and Waterman was \u0022I Should Be So Lucky\u0022: her debut album sold seven million copies.\n\nAt the age of 21, a romance with INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence led to a change in her image. In 2000, inspired by 1970s disco and assisted by gold hot pants, her single \u0022Spinning Around\u0022 became her first British number one for a decade. She also sang to an estimated global audience of 3.7 billion at the closing ceremony of the Sydney Olympics.\n\nIn May 2005 she was diagnosed with breast cancer: following treatment she resumed the tour 18 months later. \n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-13T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Kylie Minogue"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06r0vsn","title":"Atul Gawande","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06s7y34","title":"Commander Chris Hadfield","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06rl9lh","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03bqsmv","duration":2127,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
