Claude-Michel always knew he would be a composer. As a small boy growing up in Brittany he would play the piano and compose pieces for his mother. He dreamt of getting away from his little village on the French coast and going to live in Paris and compose operas.\n\nTo please his mother Claude-Michel went to University to study mathematics, but whilst he was there he formed a band and began writing songs. They caught the attention of an EMI A\u0026R man which resulted in two singles and a job for Claude-Michel as an A\u0026R assistant. Claude-Michel enjoyed a brief career as a pop star, when he had a huge hit in France with Le Premier Pas (The first date) - a song that is still played on the radio there today. During this time he had met lyricist Alain Boublil who had been impressed with his pop songs and both were keen to take on a bigger project. The result was La R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise which did moderately well in France. The duo perfected their skills when they went on to create the hugely successful musicals Les Miserables, Miss Saigon and Martin Guerre.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Beim Schlagengehen by Richard Strauss\nBook: All the Little Live Things by Wallace Earle Stegner\nLuxury: Grand piano","first_broadcast_date":"2003-03-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Claude-Michel Schonberg"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937pk","title":"Nick Danziger","first_broadcast_date":"2003-03-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937mp","title":"Kristin Scott Thomas","first_broadcast_date":"2003-03-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00937np","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz6s","duration":2229,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
