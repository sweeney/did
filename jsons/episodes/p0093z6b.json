Recently honoured by the Royal Television Society as Journalist of the Year, he\u0027ll be talking about his life covering foreign affairs for the BBC. In that capacity, he has reported on most of the momentous upheavals of the last few years - from Tiananmen Square to the release of Nelson Mandela, from the fall of Ceausescu to the collapse of the Berlin Wall.\n\nMore recently, he was one of the very few journalists to stay on in Baghdad when the Allies began their bombardment of Iraq. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his time there, as well as his other - more frightening rather than thrilling - experiences as the BBC\u0027s Foreign Affairs Editor.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Il N\u0027y A Plus D\u0027Apres by Juliette Greco\nBook: A title in French by Marcel Proust\nLuxury: Flute","first_broadcast_date":"1991-05-19T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Simpson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093z71","title":"Cecil Lewis","first_broadcast_date":"1991-05-12T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093z5l","title":"Rt Hon John Smith","first_broadcast_date":"1991-05-26T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093z6d","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfj5","duration":2333,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
