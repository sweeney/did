Although his cockney accent is part of his singing style, he was actually born in Hastings and moved to London as a child. His singer mother was perhaps a subconscious inspiration, but Suggs didn\u0027t have any particular ambitions in his teens. He dropped out of school and did what a lot of teenage boys do - formed a band with his friends. \n\nMadness, a seven-piece gang of friends, became a huge success. Their first single \u0027The Prince\u0027 went to number 16 in 1979 and three years later they had a number one with House of Fun. In seven years they had 20 singles in the top twenty UK chart and travelled the world playing to large audiences. Now Madness occasionally meet up and play their hits list, and Suggs has launched a successful solo career and is also working in TV, hosting Night Fever on Channel 5 and captaining a team on BBC1\u0027s A Question of Pop. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Is That All There Is? by Peggy Lee\nBook: A concise book of Italian verbs\nLuxury: A nucleus of bees","first_broadcast_date":"2002-05-19T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Suggs"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947r7","title":"Sir Aaron Klug","first_broadcast_date":"2002-05-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947pp","title":"Sue Johnston","first_broadcast_date":"2002-05-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00947qm","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzc6","duration":2025,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
