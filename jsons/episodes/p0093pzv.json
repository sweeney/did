He will be talking to Sue Lawley about the rocky route from his first job as an electrician, through Bromley Rep, summer seasons and pantos, to the moment he was spotted for a television show called Do Not Adjust Your Set. Some success followed this, but it was when the BBC offered him the part of Delboy in Only Fools and Horses, to be followed 10 years later by the avuncular Pop Larkin in The Darling Buds of May, that the nation took him to their hearts. He went on to win a BAFTA for his role in Porterhouse Blue, and, more recently, acclaim for his portrait of Inspector Frost.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Help! by The Beatles\nBook: The Complete Boatbuilder\u0027s Book\nLuxury: A complete carpenter\u0027s toolbox","first_broadcast_date":"1994-12-25T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Jason OBE"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093q0h","title":"Penelope Hobhouse","first_broadcast_date":"1994-12-18T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pyw","title":"Alan Clark","first_broadcast_date":"1995-01-01T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pzx","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdym","duration":2014,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
