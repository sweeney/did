He realised that while rock music had many heroes, there were few villains - that was the territory he marked out for himself.  He developed his trademark look - blackened eyes, straggly hair and glamorous clothes - and set about designing live shows that were gleefully gory and macabre.  \n\nWhile critics have described him as \u0027the world\u0027s most beloved heavy metal entertainer\u0027, it took him a while to untangle himself from his creation.  \u0022For a long time I honestly didn\u0027t know where I began and Alice ended.  My friends at the time were Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and I was trying to keep up with them.  And I realised when they all died that you didn\u0027t have to be your character off stage.\u0022    \n\nRecord:    Work Song - The Butterfield Blues Band\nBook:       Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut\nLuxury:     An indoor golf driving range\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-11-21T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alice Cooper"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00vy3rr","title":"Anna Del Conte","first_broadcast_date":"2010-11-19T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00w6pny","title":"Robert Harris","first_broadcast_date":"2010-11-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00w10zp","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyz8","duration":2177,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
