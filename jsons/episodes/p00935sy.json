The Shakespearean actor was nearly 50 when he was offered the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the TV series Star Trek: The Next Generation. Contrary to predictions, the programme was a huge hit, and Patrick Stewart\u0027s famously bald cranium was on posters, duvet covers and Star Trek memorabilia the world over. Patrick was born in Mirfield, Yorkshire, a town with a passion for amateur dramatics. The youngest of three brothers, he grew up watching performances by the all-female drama company to which his mother belonged. After a disastrous stint as a reporter, Patrick went on to work in repertory theatre around Britain, and then to a successful career with the RSC, during which he won an Olivier Awardfor his portrayal of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice. After seven series at the helm of the Starship Enterprise, he has returned to Britain and to his first love, the theatre. He is currently appearing in David Mamet\u0027s A Life in the Theatre in London\u0027s West End.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings by Benjamin Britten\nBook: A compendium of the world\u0027s best science fiction\nLuxury: His beloved billiard table and a shed to keep it in","first_broadcast_date":"2005-04-17T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Patrick Stewart"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935tx","title":"Philippe Petit","first_broadcast_date":"2005-04-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935rv","title":"Jarvis Cocker","first_broadcast_date":"2005-04-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935sz","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0g3","duration":2131,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
