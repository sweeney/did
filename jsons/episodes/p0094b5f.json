She first became a household name in the 1960s in the BBC sitcom The Rag Trade. Since then she has starred in everything from Carry On films to Chekhov. One of our most versatile actresses, she\u0027s been a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, sung in West End musicals and directed at the National. Twelve years ago she developed cancer, an experience which naturally made her re-assess her life. Today, she says, she\u0027s calmer, more secure and more able to cherish herself.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: String Quartet No.8 - Opening by Dmitri Shostakovich\nBook: A title by Marcel Proust\nLuxury: Grand piano (and music scores)","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-27T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sheila Hancock"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b5v","title":"Michael Holroyd","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b4l","title":"Robert McCrum","first_broadcast_date":"2000-03-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094b5h","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzpj","duration":2243,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
