Her home is a caravan in the grounds of a Carmelite Monastery where she spends her days in silence - speaking only once a day to the nun charged with delivering her daily food rations of skimmed milk, cold cooked vegetables and two rice crackers.\n\nHer self-imposed isolation has only been broken by the - frankly rather unlikely - occurrence of a television career. She is the nun who knows about art and her passionate and pithy critiques of the world\u0027s great works and hidden treasures have won her many devoted fans. \n\nWith decades of solitude and prayer under her belt she seems, unlike nearly every other guest, to be perfectly cut out for a stretch alone on a desert island.\n\nShe says \u0022It\u0027s my apostolic duty to talk about art. If you don\u0027t know about God, art is the only thing that can set you free\u0022. \n\nProducer: Christine Pawlowsky.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-16T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sister Wendy Beckett"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01p6ryx","title":"Rt Hon Eric Pickles MP","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01pf6dx","title":"Dawn French","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01p9g15","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnymm","duration":2325,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
