His father had also worked for the company and through visits to Iran as a boy, he witnessed spectacular oil-well blow-outs which gave him a fascination for the business. He joined BP after leaving university, starting at the sharp end as a petroleum engineer in Alaska in the 1970s. For 20 years, he travelled the world, working his way up the ladder before permanently settling in London. \n\nAlmost 10 years ago, he said that oil companies must take seriously the threat of global warming and take measures to tackle the issue. He was knighted in 1998, and created a life peer in 2001 as Lord Browne of Madingley.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: An extract from the end of Act 1 of Cosi Fan Tutte by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: Other Men\u0027s Flowers: An Anthology of Poetry  by Lord Wavell\nLuxury: A lifetime\u0027s supply of great cigars","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-02T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Browne"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vfn","title":"Peter Mansfield","first_broadcast_date":"2006-06-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vd5","title":"Monty Don","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vdw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0b8","duration":2111,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
