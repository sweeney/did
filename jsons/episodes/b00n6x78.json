He was born in Warsaw before the Second World War and lived through the uprising of 1944. He spent his childhood in Poland, Bavaria, Vienna and Italy, before making his home in England more than 60 years ago. The folk traditions of central Europe are still much in evidence in his work though; twice winner of the Kate Greenaway Medal, his illustrations see childhood terrors realised in gothic scenes, with witches a constant presence.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Eleanor Rigby by The Beatles\nBook: Audiobook of Martin Jarvis reading Just William by Richmal Crompton\nLuxury: Large supply of moleskin sketch books.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-18T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jan Pienkowski"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00n4754","title":"Steve Coogan","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ncwp6","title":"Professor Colin Pillinger","first_broadcast_date":"2009-10-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00n6x2h","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzvd","duration":2233,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
