The son of a preacher man, he was brought up in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and his first guitar was made from an old inner tube tied to the barn door. By the age of 14, he had his own guitar and ran away to Memphis with two dollars in his pocket for a life touring small blues clubs.\n\nWith hits like Boom Boom, Dimples and Boogie Chillun, he has been one of the major influences on rock stars like Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Goin Down Slow by B.B. King \u0026 Bobby Bland\nBook: A book with pictures (of pretty women)\nLuxury: His guitar","first_broadcast_date":"1995-06-11T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Lee Hooker"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093phm","title":"Brian Blessed","first_broadcast_date":"1995-06-04T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pg8","title":"Sir Magdi Yacoub","first_broadcast_date":"1995-06-18T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093ph0","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdw1","duration":1935,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
