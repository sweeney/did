Their specialty is what are known in the business as \u0022shiny floor shows\u0022 - programmes that involve big budgets, big audiences and, frequently, big egos.\n\nYet their partnership exists well beyond the four walls of a TV studio. As 13 year olds they bonded over a mutual appreciation of Newcastle United FC and Wham: they pledged themselves to be best buddies forever and now live just a few doors down from each other. When Ant got married Dec was best man.\n\nThey say, \u0022without doubt, the best thing to come out of the last twenty years, the greatest thing we\u0027ve ever achieved, our biggest success, has been our friendship. And nothing will ever change that.\u0022\n\nAt the end of the programme, Ant and Dec each chose their favourite track to save from the waves: Ant\u0027s was Morecambe \u0026 Wise\u0027s \u0022Bring Me Sunshine\u0022 while Dec chose \u0022Wichita Lineman\u0022 by Glen Campbell.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-29T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ant and Dec"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03m3nhk","title":"Miranda Hart","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-22T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03nrpc3","title":"Ray Mears","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03mckq4","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyg6","duration":2089,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
