An expert in Middle Eastern Affairs, she\u0027s a professor of politics and women\u0027s studies and Islamic law as well as being a cross-bench peer. She grew up in Iran and France living a life of huge privilege but, inspired by reading Jane Eyre, she decided she needed to learn to stand on her own two feet. She came to Britain as a boarding school pupil when she was 14 and has made her home here.\n\nShe has been an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime and, coming from a long line of independent-minded women, that\u0027s little surprise. Her mother campaigned for women to have the vote while her grandmother refused to wear the veil. Though in her grandmother\u0027s case, that was because she thought she was too pretty to be covered up.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nRecord: Prelude to Bach\u0027s Cello Suite No.1\nBook: Collected poems by Hafiz\nAlternate to Bible: Koran\nLuxury: A rose bush.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-12-28T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Baroness Haleh Afshar"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00g2156","title":"James Nesbitt","first_broadcast_date":"2008-12-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00g9cjd","title":"Simon Murray","first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00g42kb","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzyl","duration":2138,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
