Her first love is the theatre and she\u0027s been highly acclaimed for her stage work in plays by Ibsen, Shaw, Shakespeare, Beckett - she relishes and shines in the difficult roles. Yet as one of our leading classical actresses she has no qualms about turning her talents to TV and film - Calendar Girls, Shaun of the Dead and Dr Who are among her more recent on screen appearances. \n\nIn-spite of being one of our best regarded actresses she is intensely private, intent upon disappearing into the lives of her characters. Penelope says that thing about being an actor is that you turn into other people, you have to hide yourself a bit in order to let that other person come out. People should see the character on the stage, not the actor. \n\nPenelope grew up the middle of three girls and says that her mother was frail and often ill - she says this taught her to be self contained: \u0022I was always worried that I would hurt her by taking a different view so one was sort of being terribly amenable - well of course that\u2019s not in one\u0027s nature, I\u2019m quite sharp and rather argumentative.\u0022\n\nFavourite track: The 2nd movement of String Quintet in C Major by Franz Schubert\nBook: An anthology of 20th Century European poetry \nLuxury: An open-air cinema with a selection of films","first_broadcast_date":"2008-03-30T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Penelope Wilton"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b009hsnt","title":"Stanley McMurtry","first_broadcast_date":"2008-03-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00b6x4g","title":"Annie Lennox","first_broadcast_date":"2008-05-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b009lvf4","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp01m","duration":2268,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
