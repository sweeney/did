Born, she says, with \u0027frilly teeth, big glasses and beige hair\u0027 she also came with a healthy measure of ambition, brains and creativity and she used those talents to pioneer a new style of television. \n\nIn this personal interview, she describes how, as she gets older, she can\u0027t bear to look in a mirror and see traces of her mother; how her shyness can make it difficult for her to walk into a room full of strangers and that what she likes best is to be walking in the hills, in the rain and sleet, mulling over ideas for her next project. She may be a pensioner with a good body of work behind her, but, she says, her mind is on the career that lies ahead.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Always on My Mind by Pet Shop Boys\nBook: Larousse Gastronomique by Hamlyn\nLuxury: Notebook and Pens.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Janet Street-Porter"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ffv1z","title":"David Davis MP","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00fn89g","title":"Michael Eavis","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00fk9tv","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzz1","duration":2256,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
