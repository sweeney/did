She is known for her photography and short films, including \u0027David\u0027 - a film of the footballer David Beckham sleeping - and her 365-degree photograph that was wrapped around the Selfridges store in central London. She is one half of art\u0027s most glamorous couple - her husband is the art dealer Jay Jopling.\n\nHer route into art was scattered and uncertain. Although she knew she wanted to study art, she ended up taking a BTech in fashion before studying art at Goldsmiths. In 1997 she was awarded a prize as the most promising new artist at the Venice Biennale, but the same year saw the birth of her daughter and within months she was diagnosed with colon cancer. She fought it off only to find within a few years, that she was suffering from breast cancer. She emerged from illness with a major show at the Haywood Gallery - said to be the youngest person to be granted a retrospective there. She now says that her illness has given her a drive to keep working - and to do whatever seems the most fun. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Tiny Dancer by Elton John\nBook: Birthday Letters by Ted Hughes\nLuxury: Karaoke machine","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-16T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sam Taylor-Wood"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093878","title":"Andy McNab","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093635","title":"Dr Jonathan Miller","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009363v","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0gt","duration":2086,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
