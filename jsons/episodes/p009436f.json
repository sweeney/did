His West End successes include Shirley Valentine, Medea and Stepping Out. A gambler at heart, he continued to run Blood Brothers on Broadway despite a panning by the New York critics and it became a huge box office hit. An actor himself - most famously as Gordon Glegg in Coronation Street - he started producing in the provinces. There he lured audiences into the theatre by putting TV stars such as Pat Phoenix on stage - although sometimes he had to remind them that she wasn\u0027t Elsie Tanner.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Call To Arms (Everton FC and Z Cars Theme Tune) by Blueknowz\nBook: Everton - The Complete Record by Steve Johnson\nLuxury: Guitar\u0022","first_broadcast_date":"1998-06-14T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Bill Kenwright"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094375","title":"Geoffrey Smith","first_broadcast_date":"1998-06-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009435n","title":"John Bird","first_broadcast_date":"1998-06-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009436j","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfv1","duration":2046,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
