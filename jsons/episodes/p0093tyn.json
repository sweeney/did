He is one of only three chefs working in Britain today to be awarded three Michelin stars and last year his restaurant, The Fat Duck, was named the best in the world by a panel of 5,000 food experts. \n\nHis speedy rise to the top of his profession is little short of extraordinary. He has only ever spent a week in a professional kitchen and taught himself classical French cookery. He became fascinated by the science of cooking and has become the Willy Wonka of modern cuisine - dishes he\u0027s created include mango and douglas fir puree, salmon poached with liquorice and, most famously, snail porridge. But he acknowledges his success has been largely due too to his wife\u0027s support and now wants to change the balance of his life towards spending more time with his young family.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Love has Finally Come at Last by Bobby Womack\nBook: On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen by Harold McGee\nLuxury: Japanese knives","first_broadcast_date":"2006-10-29T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Heston Blumenthal"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tzn","title":"Camila Batmanghelidjh","first_broadcast_date":"2006-10-22T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tx6","title":"Humphrey Lyttelton","first_broadcast_date":"2006-11-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093tyr","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp08g","duration":2212,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
