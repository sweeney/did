She has dedicated much of her life to finding a cure for the severest form of muscular dystrophy. Before she was 40, she had helped to develop the antenatal test which is now used around the world, then she isolated the gene sequence which could be instrumental in treating the condition. After years spent working on that, human trials for a possible treatment are about to begin.\n\nIt\u0027s quite something for a woman who doesn\u0027t have an O-level in biology. Although, even as a child she did possess that critical quality crucial to scientific pioneers: \u0022I loved solving problems,\u0022 she says, \u0022I was very tenacious and would sit in my room until I had finished the problem. I am a sticker.\u0022\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Piano Sonata in B Flat by Franz Schubert\nBook: Untold Stories by Alan Bennett\nLuxury: A piano.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-15T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Dame Kay Davies"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00h9vcx","title":"David Suchet","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00hmpbz","title":"David Walliams","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-22T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00hh942","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzy0","duration":2099,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
