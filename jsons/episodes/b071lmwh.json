He was born in London to a surgeon and a former nurse and grew up with two older siblings. At junior school he refused to let a teacher put him off his passion for acting which he continued to pursue while doing a degree in Theology at Cambridge.\n\nHe chose an acting career over law, and following a brief time at drama school, his first professional role was \u0022bashing a cymbal\u0022 in A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream at London\u0027s Regent\u0027s Park theatre in 1986. He joined the National the following year and achieved his ambition of being a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1991. His television debut was as a conman in the ITV drama Chancer and his first appearance on the big screen was in Mary Shelley\u0027s Frankenstein, directed by Kenneth Branagh. He appeared opposite George Clooney in the 2014 film The Monuments Men and was the voice of Father Christmas in the BBC\u0027s adaptation of the Julia Donaldson picture book Stick Man.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-02-28T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Hugh Bonneville"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0713rtr","title":"Dame Zaha Hadid","first_broadcast_date":"2016-02-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b072ht0p","title":"Dr Dame Sue Ion","first_broadcast_date":"2016-03-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b071lms8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03knkms","duration":2165,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
