As a young man he was a talented academic, but he left university life in the 40s to join the civil service. There he was regarded as one of the cleverest negotiators of his generation, working with Ernest Bevin on the Marshall Plan, Edward Heath on EEC membership and Harold Wilson on the Department of Economic Affairs. Lord Roll chooses eight records to take with him to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Clarinet Quintet in A major by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: Faust by Johann Wolfgang Goethe\nLuxury: Cassette recorder and cassettes","first_broadcast_date":"2001-08-26T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Roll"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00948gs","title":"Bruce Fogle","first_broadcast_date":"2001-08-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00948fm","title":"Simon Schama","first_broadcast_date":"2001-09-02T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00948g5","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzgv","duration":2202,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
