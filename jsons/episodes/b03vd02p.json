So memorable, it was truly a \u0022where were you when\u0022 moment: the answer for most of us seems to have been in front of the television as 24 million people tuned in to watch their purple chiffoned, passionate, pitch-perfect display.\n\nTheir enduring partnership is the stuff of sporting legend - British, European, World and Olympic champions - their synchronicity on and off the rink is fascinating. Both brought up in Nottingham, both only children, they took to the ice within a couple of years of each other. Jayne grew up to work as an insurance clerk, Chris was a policeman. They always seemed so normal, so nice, so much like the boy and girl next door. What a neat trick - in reality their originality, training regime and relentless pursuit of perfection has seen them push the boundaries of their chosen sport to rank among the world\u0027s elite.\n\nPart of our fascination with them also stems from the long scrutiny over their personal relationship. Never mind that over the decades they\u0027ve both married other people and had children, as recently as last year they finally admitted to a brief teenage \u0027dabble\u0027.\n\nThey say, \u0022It\u0027s an unusual relationship that we have. ... Of course we love each other. You wouldn\u0027t be able to do all that we do without love.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-16T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03tr7hy","title":"Dame Elish Angiolini","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03vzhnz","title":"Professor Hugh Montgomery","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03vd02c","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyfh","duration":2153,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
