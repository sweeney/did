Since then he has led many bands, most of which have been called \u0027herds\u0027. In conversation with Roy Plomley, he chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island, but he does not include his most famous, Woodchopper\u0027s Ball.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Moonlight In Vermont by The Johnny Smith Quintet\nBook: Music is My Mistress by Duke Ellington\nLuxury: Jaguar XJ6","first_broadcast_date":"1984-02-18T18:25:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Woody Herman"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mhrj","title":"Lord Elwyn-Jones","first_broadcast_date":"1984-02-11T18:25:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mhpt","title":"Michael York","first_broadcast_date":"1984-02-25T18:25:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mhqj","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppbwr","duration":1952,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
