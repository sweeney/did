Dr David Starkey forsook the ivory towers of academia to popularise history as a constitutional commentator in the press and as a broadcaster and writer. His approach to history is a personal one; he explains events through the lens of individual hopes, flaws and lusts and says historical influence can be seen in terms of who are \u0022the movers and shakers and the bottom wipers\u0022 in the royal court. Their equivalent can be seen in government today, he says, through the unelected advisers who take their seat on the Downing Street sofa. \n\nBorn into a working class, Quaker family in Kendal, David\u0027s formidable drive owes much to his mother\u0027s love and ambitions for her only child. David\u0027s feeling that history should not be the preserve of academics, but belongs to the public, set him on a path to a TV career, via Cambridge, the LSE, and his infamous performances on Radio 4\u0027s The Moral Maze which earned him the title of \u0027the rudest man in Britain\u0027. Now, his programmes are watched by millions and his books are bestsellers.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Dove Sono by ozart\nBook: Microcosmographia Academica by Francis M Cornford\nLuxury: Hot and cold running water, bath tub and bath oil","first_broadcast_date":"2005-02-06T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Starkey"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009362d","title":"Peter Maxwell Davies","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093612","title":"Geoffrey Palmer","first_broadcast_date":"2005-02-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009361x","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0gm","duration":2352,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
