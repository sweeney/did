Singer and actress, she was the original 1960s wild child.\n\nAt the age of 17, when she was still a convent schoolgirl in Reading, she shot to fame with the hit single As Tears Go By; written for her by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. She was Mick Jagger\u0027s mistress, she hung out with Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix, she was young, beautiful and rich and she seemed to have it all. But the glamorous life of the pop star turned into a nightmare of drugs, homelessness, suicide attempts and broken marriages.\n\nThe daughter of an Austrian baroness, her life has been full of myths and legends. She\u0027ll be telling Sue Lawley about the years of recovery, how she\u0027s found happiness in Ireland and her hopes for a Man Friday on her desert island. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Small Axe by Bob Marley \u0026 The Wailers\nBook: Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe\nLuxury: Pen from Aspreys with attached magnifying glass","first_broadcast_date":"1995-05-28T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Marianne Faithfull"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pk8","title":"Sir Bernard Ingham","first_broadcast_date":"1995-05-21T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093phm","title":"Brian Blessed","first_broadcast_date":"1995-06-04T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pjl","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdw8","duration":2136,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
