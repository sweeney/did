She is one of Britain\u0027s best known and best loved singers and has given performances in opera houses the world over under the batons of such notable conductors as Bernard Haitink, Carlos Kleiber and Georg Solti.\n\nAs a child, she had always loved singing, but was, she says, a shy, gawky girl who didn\u0027t have sharp enough elbows to get to the top. She tried her hand at teaching, but found she was so crippled with nerves that she had to abandon the idea. By good fortune she was delivered to a singing teacher who spotted her talent and gave her encouragement. It was exactly what she needed - she has enjoyed a career spanning more than 30 years and over that time has won a large and loyal army of fans.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Moonlight Music - the prelude to the final scene of Capriccio by Richard Strauss\nBook: Les Miserables by Victor Hugo\nLuxury: Lots of champagne and pistachio nuts.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-13T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Felicity Lott"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00cd5vz","title":"Antonio Carluccio","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-06T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00clxst","title":"John Stefanidis","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00chbsr","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp008","duration":2168,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
