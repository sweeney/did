For 11 years, one month and five days, almost from when she came to power to the day she left office, he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Mrs Thatcher. A former card-carrying member of the Labour Party, he became her Chief Press Secretary, adviser and supporter.\n\nHe was accused by the media of crossing the line between civil service impartiality and political support on that fateful day in Paris in November 1990, just 36 hours before she lost the leadership election. He\u0027ll be telling Sue Lawley about his childhood in Yorkshire, his training as a journalist on the Hebden Bridge Times, his transition to Press Secretary for Tony Benn, Maurice MacMillan and Barbara Castle. In 1979, no-one was more astonished than he when he was headhunted to become one of Mrs Thatcher\u0027s closest advisers, and finally one of the most influential members of her team.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Violin Concerto in B Minor - Andante by Edward Elgar\nBook: Times Atlas of the World\nLuxury: Colin Cowdrey\u0027s bowling machine","first_broadcast_date":"1995-05-21T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Bernard Ingham"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pkz","title":"Neil Simon","first_broadcast_date":"1995-05-14T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093pjj","title":"Marianne Faithfull","first_broadcast_date":"1995-05-28T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093pk9","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdwc","duration":2245,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
