World-renowned as a stunning, emotional and dramatic performer, it must surely be a very different set of characteristics she employs off stage, marshalling her company of dancers and propelling the organisation\u0027s creative journey.\n\nShe was just five years old when, sheltering from the rain she found herself in the school gym, instantly beguiled by the peace and order of a dance class. Despite her father\u0027s attempts to widen her horizons with music, sport and art lessons - her path in life was set.\n\nShe says, \u0022Life on stage is like nothing else. I\u0027ve never done heroin but I\u0027m sure that\u0027s what it\u0027s like. Every feeling and sense exploding. Every nerve in your body complete awake\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-08T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Tamara Rojo"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b045741q","title":"Biddy Baxter","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-01T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b046j44b","title":"Raja Shehadeh","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b045xxx9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyd6","duration":2130,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Front Row\u0027s Cultural Exchange: Tamara Rojo","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p016p5mb\/profiles\/tamara-rojo"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
