Born in Derbyshire 42 years ago, he\u0027s recognised today as one of Britain\u0027s most versatile performers. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his schooldays at a secondary modern and the art master who introduced him and the rest of the school to drama. He\u0027ll also be recalling the days when he couldn\u0027t walk down the street without being mobbed, so famous was he for his role as Wolfie in the BBC\u0027s television sitcom Citizen Smith.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Also Sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss\nBook: Sons and Lovers by D.H.
