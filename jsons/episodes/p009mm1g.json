In conversation with Michael Parkinson, he recalls canoeing down the Amazon, sailing twice round the world, as well as exploits in Peru and the Himalayas, and he talks about his School of Adventure in Scotland. He also chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Clair de Lune by Claude Debussy\nBook: Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame\nLuxury: Shaving kit","first_broadcast_date":"1986-11-23T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Ridgway"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mm27","title":"Hal Prince","first_broadcast_date":"1986-11-16T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mm0s","title":"Nigel Hawthorne","first_broadcast_date":"1986-11-30T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mm1m","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdd7","duration":2036,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
