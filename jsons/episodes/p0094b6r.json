Nearly 10 years after he came to England from Jamaica in 1951, he helped found the first Centre of Cultural Studies in Birmingham, with the academic Richard Hoggart. It was, he says, a reaction to how fast Britain was changing after the war, including the break up of the class structure and the growing impact of TV and the mass media. Now retired, he\u0027s still concerned by the question of British identity. In conversation with Sue Lawley, he talks about his life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: I Waited For You by Gil Fuller\nBook: Portrait of a Lady  by Henry James\nLuxury: Piano","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-13T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Stuart Hall"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b7g","title":"Simon Callow","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b5v","title":"Michael Holroyd","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094b6s","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzpn","duration":2225,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
