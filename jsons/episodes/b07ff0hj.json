Since then he\u0027s worked on all the Harry Potter films, appeared in TV sitcoms, documentaries, horror movies, quiz shows and Christmas pantomimes. \n\nBorn with Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia Congenita (SED), a rare disorder of bone growth which results in dwarfism, the view of his doctors was that he\u0027d be wheelchair bound and unlikely to live beyond his teens. Now in his mid-forties, he is married with two children of his own.\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-06-12T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Warwick Davis"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07djzyq","title":"David Nott","first_broadcast_date":"2016-06-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07gcvms","title":"Barrie Rutter","first_broadcast_date":"2016-06-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b07ff01t","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03xrq81","duration":2108,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
