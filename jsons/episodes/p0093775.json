He came from a comfortable background - his mother was a teacher and his father a travelling salesman. But his parents had greater ambitions for their son and wanted to send him to public school. Their determination led his mother to set up a business making Paddington Bear toys, and the proceeds funded Jeremy\u0027s place at Repton School. However, he was a far from ideal pupil and says he was \u0027asked to leave\u0027 apparently for inappropriate behaviour including drinking, smoking and seducing girls. He left school with no A-levels and started work as a trainee reporter on the Rotherham Advertiser. But the local news diet was not enough of a challenge and, in the middle of an assignment to a vegetable and produce show, he left the paper to seek his fortune in London, as a freelance motoring writer. \n\nHe ended up presenting Top Gear for the BBC and stayed on the programme for nine years, kick-starting it into a brash, opinionated motor show with a large and loyal fan base. He has indulged his love of speed and risk-taking through programmes including Extreme Machines and Speed. He\u0027s hosted a chat-show, Clarkson, and, more recently, his razor-sharp tongue has turned on our fellow Europeans with Meet the Neighbours. But, although his public image is as a brash, opinionated and sexist boor, he claims that he\u0027s been misrepresented - he says he\u0027s always been a bit of a mother\u0027s boy: his mother describes him as a family man who has a softer side that the public never sees. Married to his agent-cum-manager Francie, the couple have three children and two homes. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Time by Pink Floyd\nBook: Photograph album\nLuxury: Jet ski","first_broadcast_date":"2003-11-16T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jeremy Clarkson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938k7","title":"Christopher Frayling","first_broadcast_date":"2003-11-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938j9","title":"Sir Christopher Meyer","first_broadcast_date":"2003-11-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093777","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz4y","duration":1966,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
