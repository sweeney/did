He\u0027s a prolific author. His first novel was published when he was 23 and, as well as a series of children\u0027s books featuring the \u0027super spy\u0027 Alex Rider, he\u0027s also penned a slew of television crime programmes including Murder Most Horrid, Midsomer Murders and Foyle\u0027s Law. He first turned to writing when he was at boarding school; he was desperately unhappy and it offered some form of escape. His childhood was peopled by Dickensian figures - although he was brought up in lavish surroundings, his parents were distant and he was brought up by a string of nannies, while he so hated his domineering grandmother that he literally danced on her grave after her death.\n\nPerhaps it is unsurprising that his books often deal with the fragility of childhood and the robustness of children. A father now himself, he says he envies his own children their confidence and happiness. He says that he doesn\u0027t consider his work great, or even important - but he does like to think it agreeable and surprising.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: She\u0027s Always A Woman by Billy Joel\nBook: A large French dictionary\nLuxury: Fountain pen, ink and paper","first_broadcast_date":"2006-12-31T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Anthony Horowitz"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093trr","title":"Gloria Hunniford","first_broadcast_date":"2006-12-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00772lv","title":"Lady Natasha Spender","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093trl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp07s","duration":2117,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
