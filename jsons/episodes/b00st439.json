And, after signing as a schoolboy for Arsenal, he is the only man ever to have led a championship winning team across three decades. \n\nThe drama and successes of his life have been as remarkable off the pitch as on it. He found sporting glory despite being an alcoholic and even served time in prison for drink-driving. But his journey of recovery has been a remarkable one. He went back to studying, developed a love of literature and the arts and put his own money into a charity to support other sports men and women recovering from addiction. It\u0027s a transformation that his former team-mates have described as \u0027heroic\u0027. Now, he is heading to Azerbaijan to become a manager, he is planning, he says, to build the Tony Adams team.\n\nRecord: Monty Python\u0027s Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\nBook: The book of Alcoholics Anonymous \nLuxury: Football.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-27T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Tony Adams"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00sqkg8","title":"Lewis Gilbert","first_broadcast_date":"2010-06-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00sw7fd","title":"Dame Fanny Waterman","first_broadcast_date":"2010-07-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00st408","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzqw","duration":2212,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
