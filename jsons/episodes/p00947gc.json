He\u0027s best known for his laconic sophistication in films such as Dangerous Liaisons, In the Line of Fire and The Man in the Iron Mask. He was celebrated in 1999\u0027s Being John Malkovich, in which he played himself. Malkovich was born in rural America, where his family ran the local newspaper. He attended Illinois State University but soon changed his major from environmental studies to drama. He and two friends formed the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, an experimental theatre company, in 1976. Based in Chicago, it became one of the most exciting regional groups in America. Malkovich acted in, directed and helped on dozens of plays, while earning money painting houses and driving school buses. \n\nIn 1983 Malkovich made his New York debut in an off-Broadway production of Sam Shepard\u0027s True West and won an Obie award for his performance. This led to the role of Biff in the 1984 Broadway revival of Arthur Miller\u0027s Death of a Salesman, in which Dustin Hoffman played Willy Loman. Their performances were captured for posterity in a film version a year later. John has received three Oscar nominations for Places In The Heart, The Killing Fields and In the Line of Fire. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Who Knows Where The Time Goes by Nina Simone\nBook: The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner\nLuxury: A cappuccino maker","first_broadcast_date":"2002-12-01T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Malkovich"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947gl","title":"Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith MP","first_broadcast_date":"2002-11-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947g4","title":"Linton Kwesi Johnson","first_broadcast_date":"2002-12-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00947gd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz8f","duration":2021,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
