Her most famous creation is Adrian Mole, and, in many respects, his life mirrors her own: like her hero, she comes from a poor but not deprived background and always nursed a secret ambition to be a writer. She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her life and work and carefully selecting eight records which remind her of some of the most significant events in her life.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Violin Concerto in D by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nBook: Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis\nLuxury: Swimming pool of champagne","first_broadcast_date":"1991-12-08T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sue Townsend"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ylr","title":"Fred Dibnah","first_broadcast_date":"1991-12-01T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093yjq","title":"Gorden Kaye","first_broadcast_date":"1991-12-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093yl2","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppffr","duration":2514,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
