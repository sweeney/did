An Austrian who\u0027s lived in the UK for many years, he was born in 1931 in what is now the Czech Republic. Although not from a musical family, he began playing the piano aged six and gave his first recital aged 17. Largely self-taught, in addition to his live performances, he\u0027s enjoyed a long and successful recording career. Revered for his intellect and individual and original take on the world, he is also a published poet and essayist.\n\nHe says, \u0022I regard pessimism as a sign of intelligence. Optimism is a very welcome and life-enhancing feature, a gift, but not necessarily a realistic outlook. I am a pessimist who enjoys being pleasantly surprised.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-15T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alfred Brendel"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03g8d6d","title":"Sir Ken Robinson","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-03T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03hmntl","title":"Malorie Blackman","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-17T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03h74f9","duration":2580,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyh0","duration":2139,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
