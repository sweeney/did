In the 1980s he changed the shape of our high streets with his chain Next. In the 1990s he made supermarket clothes fashionable with his George range for Asda and in 2001 he launched his Per Una collection in Marks and Spencer - it\u0027s credited with helping the store find renewed financial success. He was brought up in Liverpool and showed early promise as a footballer - he was talent-spotted by the legendary Bill Shankly, but wasn\u0027t good enough to play at the highest level. Then he nearly became a dentist but, after dropping out of university, found a job with Littlewoods as stock controller in charge of children\u0027s ankle socks. From the day he started he says he never looked back - he knew his future lay in retail. \n\nHis trick is knowing his market, and he does that by carefully studying the details of how his clothes sell. Each week he analyses sales figures for every garment, in every store up and down the country - the result, he says, is that he not only knows what women like, he knows what they think.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: You\u0027ll Never Walk Alone by Gerry and the Pacemakers\nBook: A book about learning to paint \nLuxury: A Cannondale Bike","first_broadcast_date":"2006-06-11T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"George Davies"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vjf","title":"Armando Iannucci","first_broadcast_date":"2006-06-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vfn","title":"Peter Mansfield","first_broadcast_date":"2006-06-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vhw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0bh","duration":2075,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
