He\u0027s had a testing four and a half years in the job - his tenure has coincided with an epidemic of foot and mouth disease, as well as a series of ongoing public health controversies played out in the media, such as the safety of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and concerns over genetically-modified crops. \n\nHe was born in South Africa and brought up in a middle-class suburb of Johannesburg. As a teenager he was taken by his school to visit a township to see how black South Africans lived. He says it was an eye-opening experience and, while he pursued his scientific studies, he also took a stance against the political regime and wrote letters denouncing apartheid. His activism brought him to the attention of South Africa\u0027s secret police - he was questioned and left with little option but to leave the country. He came to Britain and continued his studies here. He pursued an academic career - he was made the 1920 Professor of Physical Chemistry at Cambridge University in 1988, a post he still holds, and has recently been confirmed for a second term as the Government\u0027s chief scientist.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Don\u0027t Know Why by Norah Jones\nBook: Wild Reckoning, An Anthology Provoked by Rachel Carson\u0027s Silent Spring by John Burnside\nLuxury: Bunch of canvases with oils and brushes","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-22T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David King"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935np","title":"Imelda Staunton","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935lq","title":"Satish Kumar","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-29T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935ms","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0fr","duration":2119,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
