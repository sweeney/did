She is now President and Vice-Chancellor of Manchester University.\nShe claims that her decision to enrol at Queen Elizabeth College in London in the \u002770s was made not on the basis of their superior teaching on the function of living systems, but rather the institution\u0027s proximity to Kensington High Street. Anyway, she gained a first class degree and then bagged a PhD in just two years.\n\nCould it be that her interest in how we keep the human body alive and functioning began when, aged eight, she contracted primary tuberculosis and was so ill she spent 18 months at home?\n\nShe says, \u0022Like most academics my fate was sealed during my PhD, I fell in love with research and vowed I would do it until retirement. I was also sure that I would do my utmost to avoid any of those nasty administrative jobs.\u0022\n\nProducer: Christine Pawlowsky.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-04T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04vjz0b","title":"Ray Winstone","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04xmqd6","title":"Jo Malone","first_broadcast_date":"2015-01-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04wrwln","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny9b","duration":2222,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
