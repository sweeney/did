He spent more than a decade as a Fleet Street editor and pioneered a style of journalism that devoured the day-to-day lives of celebrities. Now, he has become something of a celebrity himself, fronting a TV interview programme and sitting as a judge on both America\u0027s Got Talent and Britain\u0027s Got Talent. He is, according to one friend, \u0027the ultimate proof that self-confidence and self-belief can become a self-fulfilling prophecy\u0027.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Mambo Italiano by Dean Martin \nBook: An Evil Cradling  by Brian Keenan\nLuxury: My cricket bat.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-07T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Piers Morgan"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00kmndy","title":"Caroline, Countess of Cranbrook","first_broadcast_date":"2009-05-31T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00kwftg","title":"Lord Healey","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00krk9f","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzwv","duration":2030,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
