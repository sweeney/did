But his work and influence have spread well beyond the glossy pages of style bibles. From Congolese war widows to canoodling pensioners his skill is capturing a moment of spontaneous and often surprising truth. He should really been doing peoples\u0027 tax returns - he went to college to study accountancy - but his head was turned in his halls of residence where the arts students seemed to be having all the fun. Within a few years Kate Moss was posing for him in nothing but a fedora and leather boots. However his reputation for raunch was put on the back burner the day he photographed Her Majesty The Queen - his picture of a serene and smiling monarch now hangs in The National Portrait Gallery.\n\n\nPhotography is he says \u0022like a seduction. It\u0027s a relationship compressed into a moment.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-03T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rankin"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01qsrhl","title":"Uta Frith","first_broadcast_date":"2013-02-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01r50yy","title":"David Almond","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-10T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01r09s7","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyl7","duration":2058,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
