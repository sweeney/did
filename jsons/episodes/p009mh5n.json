Six years later, he moved from Europe to America, where he joined the new Life Magazine for which he has worked ever since. In conversation with Roy Plomley, he describes some of the many stories he has covered, including the rise of Nazism, crossing the Atlantic in a Zeppelin and Marilyn Monroe, and he chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Le Notti De Cabiria by Nino Rota\nBook: A book of quotations\nLuxury: Camera","first_broadcast_date":"1984-09-22T18:25:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alfred Eisenstadt"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mh64","title":"Gerry Cottle","first_broadcast_date":"1984-09-15T18:25:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mh4p","title":"John Hurt","first_broadcast_date":"1984-09-29T18:25:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mh5p","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppbr9","duration":2104,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
