It\u0027s on the turf that\u0027s she\u0027s most at home - her father was a champion racehorse trainer and for a number of years she herself was a leading amateur flat jockey.\n\nThe first pony she ever rode, as a toddler, was a gift from the Queen; she went to public school and Cambridge but her life hasn\u0027t been an entirely easy ride. She has coped with thyroid cancer, being forcibly \u0022outed\u0022 by the tabloid press and in her own words being \u0022a disappointment from the moment\u0022 she was born.\n\nShe says, \u0022This may sound nauseating but I\u0027m a very happy person. I love my work, I love my life and I\u0027m told by those who know and love me that it\u0027s a bit like living with Tigger\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-01T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Clare Balding"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03j8srb","title":"Rt Hon Ed Miliband","first_broadcast_date":"2013-11-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03kpkyj","title":"Barbara Hulanicki","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03jydz6","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnygr","duration":2037,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
