George was born in Lexington, Kentucky in 1961, the son of Nick Clooney, a TV newscaster. From the age of five, George spent time pottering round his father\u0027s sets, joining in where possible, shouting out the temperature during the weather report. After an initial plan to follow his father into broadcasting, then studying for a short while at Northern Kentucky University, George failed to join the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. But then he got a part in a small film through his uncle, the actor Jose Ferrer. The film was never released, but it had persuaded George of his vocation. \n\nNow decided on a career in acting, George moved to L.A. in 1982 and for a year tried to get a role while he slept in a friend\u0027s closet. His first film, in which he starred with Charlie Sheen, stayed unreleased, but got him the producers\u0027 attention for later contracts. He got parts in sit-coms such as The Facts Of Life, and Roseanne, and earned decent money, although fame eluded him. Then came a part as Doug Ross in the US TV drama ER. It was to be a huge success and made George\u0027s name around the world. Film parts soon flooded in and today he is one of Hollywood\u0027s biggest stars, featuring in many Hollywood blockbusters such as From Dusk Til Dawn, One Fine Day, The Peacemaker, Out of Sight, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Ocean\u0027s Eleven. After numerous Golden Globe and Emmy nominations, in 2001 George was awarded a Golden Globe for best leading actor in a comedy for O Brother, Where Art Thou?\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Destination Moon by Dinah Washington\nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: An anchored yacht","first_broadcast_date":"2003-02-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"George Clooney"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937s4","title":"Cornelia Parker","first_broadcast_date":"2003-02-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938nx","title":"Gene Pitney","first_broadcast_date":"2003-03-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00937r9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz7b","duration":2065,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
