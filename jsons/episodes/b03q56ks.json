She did however have a sense, from the age of just 14, that her future lay in faith.\n\nShe wasn\u0027t wrong and the combination of her belief and dynamism has taken her to as close to the top as The Church of England will currently allow. If they do eventually permit women bishops it\u0027s easy to imagine she\u0027d be a shoe in.\n\nShe says \u0022Oh I have lots of ambition. You can\u0027t be Jamaican and not be ambitious. My ambition is to enjoy life. My ambition is to do everything I do to the best of my ability.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-19T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03pdfp7","title":"Nicola Benedetti","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-12T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03p8wdc","title":"Sir Ben Ainslie","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-26T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03q56kd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyfw","duration":2078,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
