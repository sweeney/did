He and Mick Jagger went to the same primary school, but then lost touch until meeting again at Dartford train station in 1961 and discovering they shared a taste in blues music. Keith picked up his love of the guitar from his grandfather and honed his skills whilst at art college.\n\nIf one single, living person could be said to personify rock n\u0027 roll then it is surely him. He\u0027s been making music and causing havoc for over half a century and counting. His song writing, singing and guitar playing have helped to make The Rolling Stones a stratospherically successful group and his early and single minded dedication to the triumvirate pursuits of sex and drugs and rock and roll made him a counter-culture icon. \n\nNo surprise then that as a boy he would go to sleep at night with his arm around his first guitar. \n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-10-25T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Keith Richards"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06j0wf3","title":"Professor Sue Black","first_broadcast_date":"2015-10-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06ltb4g","title":"Marjorie Wallace","first_broadcast_date":"2015-11-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06k9tq0","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p035xnq3","duration":2080,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
