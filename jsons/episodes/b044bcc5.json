His cooking captures not just the essence of his homeland - using ingredients like reindeer tongue, sea buckthorn or fish scales - but also a strong flavour of \u0027now\u0027. He believes traditional notions of luxury are outdated. A sense of \u0027time and place\u0027 are his kitchen\u0027s guiding principles.\n\nHis childhood was split between Denmark and Macedonia, where he spent his summers foraging in the woods. He as good as stumbled into catering, because he couldn\u0027t think of anything better to do, but pretty quickly realised that cooking allowed him to dream.\n\nHe says, \u0022The day when there is no more to do is the day when you\u0027re burned out. There are endless possibilities - it\u0027s just whether you can see them or not ... and right now I see plenty.\u0022.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-25T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rene Redzepi"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b043wk0j","title":"Alison Moyet","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b045741q","title":"Biddy Baxter","first_broadcast_date":"2014-06-01T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b044bcbp","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnydh","duration":2077,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[{"type":"related_site","title":"Rene Redzepi Biography","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ren%C3%A9_Redzepi"},{"type":"related_site","title":"Follow @ReneRedzepiNoma","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReneRedzepiNoma"}],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
