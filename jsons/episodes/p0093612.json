Best known for his roles in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, Butterflies and As Time Goes By, he had to wait a long time to become a household name and national treasure. Unsure what career to pursue after a spell in the army, he fell into acting because a girlfriend was involved in amateur dramatics. He worked in repertory theatre throughout the 60s and 70s and ended up working with John Osborne during the Royal Court\u0027s heyday in West of Suez, and later with Laurence Olivier. \n\nWith a face \u0022reminiscent of a bloodhound mourning a lost scent\u0022, Palmer has, by his own admission \u0022cornered the market in playing dull, plodding men\u0022. Many of his characters live out lives characterised by petty worries, suburban frustration and missed opportunities, but he plays them brilliantly, and with a sympathy that elevates them to the status of unlikely heroes. Geoffrey\u0027s grumpy on-screen persona has also recently led to him doing the narration for the BBC TV series Grumpy Old Men, which has become a cult hit and brought him a whole new generation of viewers. He was awarded an OBE in the new year honours list.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: One O\u0027Clock Jump by Benny Goodman\nBook: Oxford Book of English Verse by Chirstopher Ricks\nLuxury: Fly-fishing rod","first_broadcast_date":"2005-02-27T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Geoffrey Palmer"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009361r","title":"David Starkey","first_broadcast_date":"2005-02-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093604","title":"Alison Richard","first_broadcast_date":"2005-03-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093613","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0gk","duration":2250,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
