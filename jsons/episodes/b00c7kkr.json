Her social observation and sharp wit gained a loyal following in The Guardian where - among their stripped pine, lentils and patchwork - she depicted the lives of prototype woolly liberals Wendy and George Weber. Since then she\u0027s gone on to create highly acclaimed children\u0027s books and also graphic novels Gemma Bovary and Tamara Drew. \n\nPosy says she started drawing as soon as she could pick up a pencil and as a child was making magazines and little comics with titles like How to Turn Yourself Into an Up-to-Date Ted and How to Make Love and Be Loved in Four Easy Lessons. She remembers drawing as the perfect thing to do, because she could sit on her own and talk to herself.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The opening of the prelude from Cello Suite No 1 in G Major by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Four volumes of the London Telephone Directory\nLuxury: The Crown Jewels.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-29T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Posy Simmonds"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00c4jq3","title":"Ara Darzi","first_broadcast_date":"2008-06-22T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00cd5vz","title":"Antonio Carluccio","first_broadcast_date":"2008-07-06T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00c7jfq","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp00j","duration":2143,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
