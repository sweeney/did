She used to spend her summer holidays at Balmoral with the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret while, during the war, she worked for MI6 and lodged at Buckingham Palace. She attended the Queen\u0027s wedding and coronation and, in later life, worked as an assistant to the Queen Mother. \n\nRemembering the Queen\u0027s coronation, she says: \u0022We had only just recovered from six or seven years of deprivation and blackouts and rationing - it was like the sun suddenly coming out behind a lot of very dark clouds and I think everybody felt that with a new young Queen, a whole new era was opening up. It was somehow exciting.\u0022 \n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-06-03T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Margaret Rhodes"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01j2fdt","title":"Denise Robertson","first_broadcast_date":"2012-05-27T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01jqb8t","title":"Doreen Lawrence","first_broadcast_date":"2012-06-10T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01jg9k3","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyq1","duration":2181,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
