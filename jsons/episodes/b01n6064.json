Whimsical prints and flattering forms are her signature style and the vintage creations that she designed with her then husband Ossie Clarke now change hands for a small fortune. Her new ranges are highly collectable and fly off the high street rails too. \n\nNever one of the fashion world\u0027s flamboyant self promoters she has, none the less, a face known to millions - as a long time friend and muse to David Hockney she is the woman at the centre of his famous painting \u0022Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy\u0022.\n\nShe wants her work to be relevant because and says \u0022there\u0027s nothing worse than being out-dated. If that happens and I feel I\u0027m past it, I\u0027ll stop\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-10-07T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Celia Birtwell"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01n0t5n","title":"Ade Adepitan","first_broadcast_date":"2012-09-30T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01n9vhp","title":"Noah Stewart","first_broadcast_date":"2012-10-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01n5zxk","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyns","duration":1968,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
