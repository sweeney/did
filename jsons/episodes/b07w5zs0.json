Winner of two Grammy Awards, she is best known for her interpretations of Handel, Mozart and Rossini operas. Born into a Catholic family in Kansas, she was the second-youngest of seven children. Her love of music was awakened by watching her late father directing the local church choir. Her first ambition was to become a music teacher, but watching a televised performance of Don Giovanni during her third year at college ignited her interest in opera. After acceptance onto Houston Grand Opera\u0027s young artist programme, she overhauled her technique and went on to win second place in 1998\u0027s Operalia competition. \n\nHer first big role came in 2002 singing Rosina in The Barber of Seville in Paris and she made her debut at New York\u0027s Metropolitan Opera in 2005 at the age of 36. Since then her star has shone brightly and she has performed across the operatic spectrum, from contemporary works, such as Jake Heggie\u0027s Dead Man Walking to Strauss and Handel.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-09-25T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Joyce DiDonato"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07nng5j","title":"Nadiya Hussain","first_broadcast_date":"2016-08-14T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b07wnbj2","title":"Christiane Amanpour","first_broadcast_date":"2016-10-02T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b07w5zrk","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p048nxgb","duration":2239,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
