He says his work is not about art, but about ideas. His stage sets are a metaphor for the whole play. Thus he thrilled Ken Russell by building him four stages each resembling different parts of a woman\u0027s body. His aim? To represent the degradation of women in the 18th century.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Violin Concerto No. 1 in G Minor by Max Bruch\nBook: French dictionary\nLuxury: Cigars","first_broadcast_date":"1998-08-23T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ralph Koltai"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00942zs","title":"Les Murray","first_broadcast_date":"1998-08-16T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00942yk","title":"Lucy Gannon","first_broadcast_date":"1998-08-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00942z8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfss","duration":2245,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
