He was, he admits, perfectly qualified. In retirement he set about his biggest project - he bought a disused railway engine shed and raised tens of millions of pounds to safeguard its future as a venue for performing arts and a centre for young people.\n\nRecord: Nobody Knows You when You\u0027re Down and Out - Bessie Smith\nBook: Book by his father: Nigel Norman - Verses 1911 - 1943. \nLuxury: A miniature still with a little ice-making machine attached to it to make dry martinis.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-12T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Torquil Norman"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00wdctl","title":"Frances Wood","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00wntyl","title":"Nick Park","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00wlb6v","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyys","duration":2128,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
