A respected biographer, as a boy, he sought refuge from an unhappy home in Maidenhead Public Library. It was there he discovered the work of Hugh Kingsmill who was to become his first biographical subject. And it was then that he \u0022discovered the attraction,\u0022 as he says, \u0022of stepping from my own life into other people\u0027s\u0022. Since then he has devoted seven years to writing the life of Augustus John, and 17 to the biography of George Bernard Shaw.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Last movement of String Quartet - No16 in F Opus 135 by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The High Hill of the Muses - Anthology by Hugh Kingsmill\nLuxury: Waterbed","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-20T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Michael Holroyd"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b6r","title":"Professor Stuart Hall","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-13T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b5f","title":"Sheila Hancock","first_broadcast_date":"2000-02-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094b5x","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzpl","duration":2252,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
