She writes books about the world\u0027s religions, trying to explain that their strength lies not in dogma but profound and enduring truths. Since 9\/11 her books on Islam in particular have become best-sellers - although she has also written on Judaism, Buddhism, the Crusades and Christianity. \n\nShe was brought up in Birmingham, but at the age of 17 she left her family to become a nun. She had hoped to become enriched by the contemplative life - but it left her feeling a failure, shamed by her inability to pray as the other nuns did. After seven years she turned her back on the convent and became a teacher. Then a chance opportunity to work in television led to her studying the world\u0027s religions - and becoming fascinated by the similarities between them. Now she is in great demand as a public speaker - and when she isn\u0027t touring the world she says she leads a nun-like life; living alone, contemplating God and thinking about the nature of faith and understanding.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: 3rd movement of String Quartet in A minor by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: Complete Works by John Milton\nLuxury: Continuous supply of very cold \u0026 dry white wine","first_broadcast_date":"2006-02-12T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Karen Armstrong"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vwv","title":"Jeremy Irons","first_broadcast_date":"2006-02-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vsx","title":"Frederic Raphael","first_broadcast_date":"2006-02-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vvf","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0ck","duration":2212,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
