It\u0027s more than 30 years since he launched the Glastonbury Festival at his dairy farm in Somerset. Back in 1970, the headline act was Marc Bolan. His fee for appearing was just \u00a3500 and party-goers were given all the milk that the farm\u0027s herd of Friesians produced. \n\nOver the years Michael risked losing his farm in order to fund the festival, faced years when the event was mired in mud and was criticised for booking a hip-hop act to top this year\u0027s bill. But, he says, he always felt compelled to keep the Glastonbury Festival going and now it attracts 180,000 people each year and brings millions of pounds into the local economy.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: How Great Thou Art by Elvis Presley\nBook: Blake by Peter Ackroyd\nLuxury: A mouth organ with instruction book.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-30T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Michael Eavis"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00fkbrf","title":"Janet Street-Porter","first_broadcast_date":"2008-11-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00frmml","title":"Marcus du Sautoy","first_broadcast_date":"2008-12-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00fn7xv","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzyz","duration":2100,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
