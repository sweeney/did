She\u0027s written dozens of novels and for more than forty years been an agony aunt on local radio, papers and television. \n\nShe says: \u0022There have been times when I\u0027ve thought, just as I get things right, fate steps in and kicks the steps from under me. But then you pick yourself up again. When I started out, there used to be a joke, that one day I\u0027d open a letter without saying, \u0027Oh I remember when that happened to me\u0027.\u0022\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-05-27T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Denise Robertson"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01hw633","title":"Peter Ackroyd","first_broadcast_date":"2012-05-20T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01jgb8t","title":"Margaret Rhodes","first_broadcast_date":"2012-06-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01j2f7d","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyq5","duration":2115,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
