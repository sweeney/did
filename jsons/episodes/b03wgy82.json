Katie lives on the imaginary Isle of Struay with her parents, siblings, cousins, granny and prize-winning sheep Alecina. Like her creator she relishes the rhythms and freedoms particular to life on a wee Scottish island. But that\u0027s where the similarities end - the author was born and brought up an only child on the mainland of the lowlands. She lost her father when she was just twelve and says she was never part of a close-knit family.\n\nAs a grown-up, all she wanted was to quit the rat race and be an island crofter, but after a decade she left her dream behind in favour of a more stable income and a secondary school for her children.\n\nShe says, \u0022I have a notion that children\u0027s writers explore unresolved questions in their own childhoods. I certainly do.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Christine Pawlowsky.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-02T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Mairi Hedderwick"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03vzhnz","title":"Professor Hugh Montgomery","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03xcwp4","title":"Lord Richards of Herstmonceux","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03wgxzv","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyf7","duration":2237,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
