The programme was recorded on location in Naypyitaw, Burma in December 2012.\n\nNow Leader of Burma\u0027s opposition party, she has dedicated her life to fighting for human rights and democracy in her homeland. A figure of world renown, she is known in Burma as simply \u0022The Lady\u0022 and her integrity, determination and grace have provided a beacon of hope to a nation oppressed and exploited by decades of brutal military dictatorship. President Obama says she is an \u0022icon of democracy\u0022 and Desmond Tutu calls her \u0022a remarkable woman ... ready to work for the healing of her motherland\u0022.\n\nHer renown has come at significant personal sacrifice: she endured nearly 20 years of house arrest and persecution, exiled from her children and apart from her British husband who died from cancer in 1999. She says \u0022It takes courage to feel the truth, to feel one\u0027s conscience because once you do, you must engage your fundamental purpose for being alive. You can\u0027t just expect to sit idly by and have freedom handed to you.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale\n\n\nBoth the on-demand and the download audio of this programme are an extended edition of the original broadcast.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-01-27T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Aung San Suu Kyi"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01pz593","title":"Beryl Vertue","first_broadcast_date":"2013-01-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01qdr2m","title":"Sir Terry Leahy","first_broadcast_date":"2013-02-03T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01q7gnj","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnylx","duration":2684,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
