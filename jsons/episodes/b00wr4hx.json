She loathed the song at the time, but has recently come to terms with it after recording a new version which is, she says, rather forlorn.\n\nAlong with the highs have been terrible lows - years that she calls her dark ages, when, without money or creative freedom, she felt hopeless. It was Buddhism that turned her fortunes around and became central to her life. Now, she says, she cannot believe the journey life has taken her on and she is preparing for a final flourish as a performer. \n\nRecord: None of them!\nBook: Lecture on The Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life\nby Daisaku Ikeda \nLuxury: Omamori Gohonzon\n\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-26T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sandie Shaw"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00wntyl","title":"Nick Park","first_broadcast_date":"2010-12-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00x31sq","title":"Tony Iveson","first_broadcast_date":"2011-01-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00wr4f2","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyyl","duration":2157,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
