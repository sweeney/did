He moved to Canada and in 1964 was a member of the Canadian Olympic Bobsled team. He is a retired businessman with a taste for adventure, philanthropy and cricket (he is a patron of Somerset County Cricket Club). He is a member of the exclusive club of Labour\u0027s \u0027million plus\u0027 donors and his philanthropy does not stop there - he has also given over a million pounds to the Royal Geographical Society and the National Portrait Gallery, who named a wing of the gallery after him. \n\nMarried with three children and 12 grandchildren, Mr Ondaatje is now based in London when he is not travelling the world. His lust for adventure has fuelled several books - most famously Journey to the Source of the Nile. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Einleitung \/ Introduction by Richard Strauss\nBook: Anthology of Poetry by Robert Service\nLuxury: The Blue Nude by Justin Deranyagala","first_broadcast_date":"2002-11-17T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Christopher Ondaatje"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947gz","title":"Marguerite Wolff","first_broadcast_date":"2002-11-15T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947gl","title":"Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith MP","first_broadcast_date":"2002-11-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00947gt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz8k","duration":2112,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
