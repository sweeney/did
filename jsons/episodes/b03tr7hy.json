It\u0027s a long way from Govan where her father heaved bags of coal round the streets and there wasn\u0027t always money for the meter. She was the youngest of four and by her own admission being \u0022gabby\u0022 was the only way she got heard.\n\nIt\u0027s an early skill that seems to have served her pretty well - in the legal establishment she gained a reputation as a gutsy moderniser, unafraid to challenge the system. Among her innovations a pioneering support scheme for vulnerable victims and establishing the National Crimes Sex Unit for Scotland - the first of its kind in Europe. \n\nHer predisposition to seeing things from the victim\u0027s point of view might have something to do with her own experience - in 1984 she was badly injured in a rail disaster that killed 13 others - including the two men sitting opposite her.\n\nShe says \u0022... Advocacy is a great life skill. If you go to your bank manager asking for an overdraft, or if you barter at a market, you are employing advocacy skills. It is all about empathy and charisma.\u0022\n\nProducer: Paula McGinley.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-09T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dame Elish Angiolini"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03sr7dy","title":"Bob Harris","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03vd02p","title":"Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03tr6mf","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyfl","duration":1964,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
