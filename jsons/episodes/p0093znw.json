A pale and gaunt Brian Keenan emerged from a captivity of appalling deprivation and isolation after being kidnapped in Beirut by Islamic extremists.\n\nThis week on Desert Island Discs, he will be talking to Sue Lawley about those lost years, when, often blindfolded, chained and alone, he relived his life, conjuring up forgotten sights and sounds through imagined magical music, or by singing half-remembered lines from songs with John McCarthy when they were allowed to share their captivity.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Dweller On The Threshold by Van Morrison\nBook: The Life Times and Music of An Irish Harper by Donal O\u0027Sullivan\nLuxury: Pencil","first_broadcast_date":"1990-12-23T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Brian Keenan"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zpm","title":"Sir Eduardo Paolozzi","first_broadcast_date":"1990-12-02T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zn8","title":"Keith Floyd","first_broadcast_date":"1990-12-30T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zp1","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcly","duration":2221,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
