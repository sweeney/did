His life quickly took on an international flavour from West Africa to Morocco, Paris to Washington, but in his early 30s a coup in his homeland left him high and dry. He says \u0022I had no job, no career, nothing at all. It taught me a lot about myself. If you\u0027ve been in a situation where you have nothing there\u0027s nothing much you\u0027re afraid of.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-04T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Tidjane Thiam"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01nk24l","title":"Hilary Devey","first_broadcast_date":"2012-10-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01ntlrs","title":"Blanche Marvin","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-16T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01np9kt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyn9","duration":2017,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
