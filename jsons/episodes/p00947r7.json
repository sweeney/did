A bright child, he read anything that was available and enjoyed an idyllic childhood. He started studying medicine at university level in Johannesburg at the age of fifteen, but soon switched to chemistry, physics and mathematics, which provided more stimulus for his enquiring mind.\n\nHe began to research at Cape Town University and later Cambridge, where he joined the world-famous Cavendish Laboratory and later the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. His work led to him winning the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1982 for his work on cell structure. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Ode to Joy (Symphony No 9) by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: A set of books on Roman Republican and Imperial coinage\nLuxury: A set of mixed Greek and Roman coinage","first_broadcast_date":"2002-05-12T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Aaron Klug"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947s3","title":"Jude Kelly","first_broadcast_date":"2002-05-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947qk","title":"Suggs","first_broadcast_date":"2002-05-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00947r8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzcd","duration":2123,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
