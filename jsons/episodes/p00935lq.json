He has dedicated his life to promoting a peaceful, measured way of living; walking thousands of miles to raise awareness for his cause. Satish was born in Rajasthan, India, in 1936. As a child he decided to follow a spiritual life and, until he was 18, Kumar lived the life of an itinerant Jain monk, travelling from village to village with no more possessions than a begging bowl and a change of clothes. \n\nThen in 1961, news from Britain reached Kumar. The 90-year-old philosopher and peace campaigner Bertrand Russell had been arrested for his anti-nuclear activities and sentenced to a week in prison. Kumar saw it as a call to action - if a 90-year-old man was prepared to go to jail for peace, what could he, a young man in his 20s, contribute to the struggle? Together with his friend Prabhakar Menon, Satish walked to the four nuclear capitals - Moscow, Paris, London and Washington. Their journey began at the grave of Mahatma Gandhi and ended, two and a half years later at the grave of John F Kennedy. For the past 30 years Satish has edited the magazine Resurgence, which promotes an ecological way of living - and he has pioneered the Human Scale Education movement.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Ma Solitude by Georges Moustaki\nBook: The Collected Writings by Mahatma Gandhi\nLuxury: A spade","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-29T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Satish Kumar"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935mn","title":"David King","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-22T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935kv","title":"Nigel Slater","first_broadcast_date":"2005-06-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935ls","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0fp","duration":2086,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
