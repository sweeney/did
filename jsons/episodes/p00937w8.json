Gillian was born in Chicago, Illinois. When she was two, she moved with her parents to London. At 11, the family moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan which she found deathly dull in comparison to the big city life of London. Gillian began acting in community theatre productions while in high school and decided to study drama at the Goodman Theater School at Chicago\u0027s DePaul University. After she finished her degree, she moved to New York City to find work. She performed in a couple of plays, but then was cast as the female lead in a new science fiction TV series. \n\nThe X Files turned out to be a massive success and in September 1993, Gillian began a nine-year stint in the FOX TV series. For her role she received two Screen Actors Guild awards, an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series. In 1999 Gillian wrote and directed her own episode. In 2000, Gillian played Lily Bart in the Terence Davies\u0027 feature The House of Mirth and won the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress. This year she debuts on the West End in Michael Weller\u0027s What the Night is For.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley\nBook: The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle\nLuxury: Recordings of her daughter and \u0022her love\u0022 reading self-written stories and poetry","first_broadcast_date":"2003-01-12T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gillian Anderson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938qx","title":"George Foreman","first_broadcast_date":"2003-01-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00937vj","title":"Professor Baruch Blumberg","first_broadcast_date":"2003-01-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00937wd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz7y","duration":2050,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
