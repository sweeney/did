Domestic violence, murder, abduction - it\u0027s difficult to imagine a subject she\u0027d shy away from. She once described herself as \u0022A mixture of hard bitten cynical hack and Pollyanna\u0022.\n\nBrought up in a secure home by parents who were very happily married, she was the first Scot from a state school to win a place at St Hilda\u0027s college, Oxford. She was just 16. After graduation she chose tabloid journalism as her trade and by all accounts fitted right in with the hard working, bolshy, boozing culture at the time.\n\nShe says \u0022I think there are three elements to any literary career. You have to have a modicum of talent, you\u0027ve got to work hard . and you\u0027ve got to be lucky.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Isabel Sargent.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-14T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Val McDermid"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b036jc4b","title":"Jane Somerville","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b037524r","title":"Russell Brand","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b036tnkh","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyjr","duration":2104,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
