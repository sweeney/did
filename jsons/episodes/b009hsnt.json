He\u0027s been the Daily Mail\u0027s cartoonist for the past 38 years - and it\u0027s his job, he says, to make the \u0022dreary news copy of the daily paper brighter, by putting in a laugh\u0022. Since he was a child he was always drawing - inventing strip cartoons in his spare time and sketching figures in the margins of his school books. Yet despite his obvious talent, there was scant nurturing of his ambitions at home. His father told him he\u0027d never make the grade and, instead, he should concentrate on finding a proper job. \n\nBut Mac says that all the way through, he\u0027s been lucky. Whenever he\u0027s found himself stuck, he\u0027s come across someone who would encourage him to take the next step. Life has, he says, been a series of lucky coincidences.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Adagio from Bruch\u0027s Violin Concerto in G Minor by Bruch\nBook: The collected works by John Steinbeck\nLuxury: Tenor saxophone.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-03-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Stanley McMurtry"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0094zpg","title":"Tariq Ali","first_broadcast_date":"2008-03-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b009lwnd","title":"Penelope Wilton","first_broadcast_date":"2008-03-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":null}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b009hrdh","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp01s","duration":2147,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
