Matthew Pinsent won his fourth Olympic gold medal at this summer\u0027s games in Athens. His first three were all won rowing with Sir Steve Redgrave - as a pair in 1992 in Barcelona and 1996 in Atlanta and as part of the coxless four in 2000\u0027s Sydney games. This summer\u0027s success saw him lead the four to victory - in a photo-finish that saw them beat the Canadian team by less than a tenth of a second. \n\nHe won his first Gold at the Junior World Championships aged just seventeen. Between 1991 and 2002 he won a gold medal every year at the World Championships and his life was given over to rowing - he took a year out from his studies to compete in the 1992 Olympics, fitted his wedding around the rowing calendar and followed a rigorous training regime to maintain his 6\u00275\u0027\u0027, seventeen-stone frame at the peak of its strength and fitness.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Fields of gold by Sting\nBook: World Atlas, extended\nLuxury: Shaving kit","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-31T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Matthew Pinsent"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936cs","title":"Jack Mapanje","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936b8","title":"Ann Leslie","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936c2","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz1c","duration":2065,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
