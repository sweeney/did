In his own words he \u0022specialises in dragging heavy things around cold places\u0022.\n\nHe\u0027s one of only three people to have skied solo to The North Pole and he holds the record for the longest solo Arctic journey ever on foot.\n\nAfter traversing Russia and the frozen crust of the Arctic Ocean, his most recent adventure was to triumph where, a century before, Captain Scott and his men failed. Ben successfully retraced that ill-fated Terra Nova route by making the eighteen hundred mile journey through Antarctica-and-back, entirely on foot.\n\nWhen he\u0027s not wrapped up somewhere cold, he is a motivational speaker.\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-02-14T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ben Saunders"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06zqchz","title":"Professor Dame Carol Black","first_broadcast_date":"2016-02-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0713rtr","title":"Dame Zaha Hadid","first_broadcast_date":"2016-02-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0709v45","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03j80yp","duration":2122,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
