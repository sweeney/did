After leaving the royal household, he went back to Eton, where he has been Provost for the last 12 years. Among many things, Lord Charteris will be talking to Sue Lawley about the job of Private Secretary to the Queen, and how the Eton of today differs from the Eton he attended as a schoolboy some 50 years ago.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Emperor Concerto by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: Set of wood-carving tools","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-09T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lord Charteris"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009400w","title":"Robin Knox-Johnston","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-02T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zyy","title":"Dr Ruth Westheimer","first_broadcast_date":"1990-09-16T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zzz","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcp1","duration":2213,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
