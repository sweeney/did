She studied Pharmacy at the University of Manchester but never felt she was fulfilling her potential, and set up Inspire in her home. She has been at the heart of various campaigns to raise awareness of her cause from Jihad Against Violence to #MakingAStand which encouraged women in particular to stand up against extremism.\n\nIn 2009 she was listed in the Equality and Human Rights Commission Muslim Women\u0027s Power List and in 2015 was included in BBC Radio 4\u0027s Woman\u0027s Hour Power List.
