But that all changed dramatically in 1986 when he resigned his Cabinet post over the Westland affair. In conversation with Michael Parkinson, he recalls his upbringing in South Wales, schooldays at Shrewsbury, undergraduate life at Oxford and his subsequent career in politics. He also chooses the eight records to take with him to the island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: We\u0027ll Keep A Welcome in the Hillsides by Morriston Orpheus Choir\nBook: The Dictionary of Trees and Shrubs\nLuxury: Mosquito net","first_broadcast_date":"1988-01-17T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Rt.
