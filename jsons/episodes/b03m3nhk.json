Slapstick and misunderstanding underpin her work along with the impression that she\u0027s just a really, jolly, lovely \u0027girl\u0027: her father was a naval commander and her mother has devoted much of her life to tending a glorious garden.\n\nMaking her mark has been something of a slog. After her first appearance at the Edinburgh Fringe it was another 11 years before she could give up her job as a P.A. - for a good while she was photocopying scripts rather than performing them.\n\nShe says: \u0022I started writing comedy because it was more fun inside my head than the real world, but that\u0027s no longer true.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-22T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Miranda Hart"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03lknds","title":"Gillian Clarke","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03mckqs","title":"Ant and Dec","first_broadcast_date":"2013-12-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03m3kzh","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyg8","duration":2194,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
