Nearly 40 years ago, he wrote the hugely influential Uses of Literacy. In it, he argued that the working classes were being short changed - both by rampant consumerism and by the dross he felt was being churned out by the mass media.\n\nCast well away from materialism and the media on the desert island, he\u0027ll be talking about how he now feels about his original thesis and about his own working-class background in Leeds, where he was orphaned at an early age.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Fidelio: The Prisoner\u0027s Chorus From Act One by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: Essays by Michel de Montaigne\nLuxury: Fountain pen and paper","first_broadcast_date":"1995-10-15T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Richard Hoggart"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093p8h","title":"Alan Yentob","first_broadcast_date":"1995-10-08T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093p6k","title":"Don Black","first_broadcast_date":"1995-10-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093p7k","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdtg","duration":2229,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
