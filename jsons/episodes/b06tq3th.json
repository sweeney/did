He says he has been dealing with the trauma which resulted in his writing ever since. After attending St Peter\u0027s College in Wexford and University College Dublin, he spent three years in Barcelona teaching English before returning to Ireland. He worked as a journalist until his books began to get published. \n\nHe once told a class he was teaching that \u0022you have to be a terrible monster to write. I said, \u0027Someone might have told you something they shouldn\u0027t have told you, and you have to be prepared to use it because it will make a great story. You have to use it even though the person is identifiable. If you can\u0027t do it then writing isn\u0027t for you. You\u0027ve no right to be here. If there is any way I can help you get into law school then I will. Your morality will be more useful in a courtroom.\u0027\u0022\n\nProducer: Christine Pawlowsky.","first_broadcast_date":"2016-01-03T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Colm Toibin"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06sfh14","title":"Patricia Greene","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-27T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06vjhgs","title":"Alex Crawford","first_broadcast_date":"2016-01-10T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06tq21t","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03cgn56","duration":2254,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
