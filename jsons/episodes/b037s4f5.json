Responsible for locations, scenery and all the props she is renowned for creating entirely convincing, cohesive worlds that capture a beguiling sense of time, place and spirit. Not even the requirement for nine tons of Scottish seaweed or noiseless rubber rosary beads will defeat her.\n\nHer trademark is her relentless attention to detail and she slavishly trawls the archives for visual clues and references. It would seem that the bug bit her early - she says:\n\n\u0027When I was a little girl I used to have lots of doll\u0027s houses. Now I have lots of big ones and get to do it on a bigger scale.\u0027\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-08-04T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Eve Stewart"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b037gm1f","title":"Mary Robinson","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0381l2v","title":"Daniel Kahneman","first_broadcast_date":"2013-08-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b037s4ds","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyjd","duration":2092,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
