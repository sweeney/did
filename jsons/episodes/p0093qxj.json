He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about how, as a child, he found it difficult to communicate with the adult world, and didn\u0027t speak until he was four years old. But as his confidence grew, he set his sights on being a nuclear physicist - an ambition later replaced by a burning desire to be John Cleese in Monty Python\u0027s Flying Circus. In fact, he has become a hugely-successful author, a passionate amateur naturalist and a rock star manque.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nBook: Omnibus of Golfing Stories by P G Wodehouse\nLuxury: Martin D28 left-handed guitar","first_broadcast_date":"1994-02-06T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Douglas Adams"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qyn","title":"Dame Cicely Saunders","first_broadcast_date":"1994-01-30T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qwv","title":"Rosemary Verey","first_broadcast_date":"1994-02-13T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qxk","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf2m","duration":2158,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
