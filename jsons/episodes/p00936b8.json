She has witnessed and reported on some of the most significant events of the past 30 years including the fall of the Berlin wall; the failed coup against Michael Gorbachev and Nelson Mandela\u0027s final walk to freedom. She has reported on uprisings, massacres and wars, collecting numerous awards as she has done so. \n\nShe grew up in India and Pakistan and loved India and its culture. When she was around 10 years old she was sent to a boarding school in England. From school she went to Oxford and from there she joined the Daily Express. She was brought to London and was given her own column at the age of twenty-two. But she resigned, saying she wanted to do proper reporting, and it was David English\u0027s support for her that saw her start writing foreign news stories and set the course for her distinguished career.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Improvisation - The Theme Music Pather Panchali by Ravi Shankar\nBook: Completed Works by P G Wodehouse\nLuxury: An enormous amount of garlic with a garlic press","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-07T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ann Leslie"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936c0","title":"Matthew Pinsent","first_broadcast_date":"2004-10-31T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093884","title":"Matthew Bourne","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-19T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936b9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz17","duration":2086,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
