Elsewhere, his figures stand buried in sand at the mouth of an estuary, or hang from the ceiling of an American jailhouse. In 1994 he won the Turner Prize for his works called Field - thousands of small clay creatures, crafted by people from around the world. Another sculpture, Bed, he created from a mattress made from thousands of slices of bread - and then ATE his own body shape over several weeks.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Raga Jaijaiwanti by Hariprasad Chaurasia and Dilshad Khan\nBook: Principle of Hope by Ernst Bloch\nLuxury: Snorkel and mask","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-10T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Antony Gormley"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943bd","title":"Susan Blackmore","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-03T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009438s","title":"Sir David Willcocks","first_broadcast_date":"1998-05-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009439p","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfvf","duration":2094,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
