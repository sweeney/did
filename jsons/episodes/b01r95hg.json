Behind the bar of the Rovers Return her bosom swathed in leopard-print and her head piled high with platinum curls she was Manchester\u0027s answer to Mae West.

She got pregnant at 17, her second husband abandoned her for their best man, and in 1979 she was diagnosed with cancer and told she\u0027d a year to live. She\u0027s now married to her fourth husband.\n\nShe says, \u0022If anyone should be interested in an epitaph for my life, I would like them to consider, \u0027At least she tried.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-17T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Julie Goodyear"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01r50yy","title":"David Almond","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-10T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01rfy57","title":"Jasvinder Sanghera","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-24T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01r951t","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyl1","duration":2031,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
