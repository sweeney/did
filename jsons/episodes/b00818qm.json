She has the voice of an old friend - and it\u0027s not surprising, she was a BBC radio announcer during the war and has been acting and performing poetry consistently since. Poetry has always played a central role in her life. She was only 12 years old when she first saw the poet Cecil Day Lewis. He had come to judge a poetry-reading competition at her school and although he was more than 20 years her senior, he was, she says, the most beautiful man she had ever seen.\n\nThey were married for more than 20 years. Since his death in 1972, she has maintained her own acting career, continued raising their children - the acclaimed cookery writer Tamasin and Oscar-winning actor Daniel - and also worked hard to preserve his legacy.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Romanza: the 3rd movement of Symphony No 5 in D Major by Vaughan Williams\nBook: The collected works by Thomas Hardy\nLuxury: A barrel of Guerlain Jicky perfume.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-10-14T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jill Balcon"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0080mb3","title":"Alan Johnson","first_broadcast_date":"2007-10-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0084b4l","title":"Lord Joffe","first_broadcast_date":"2007-10-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00818m8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp04l","duration":2200,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
