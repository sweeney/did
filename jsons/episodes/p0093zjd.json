The Germany of Professor Ralf Dahrendorf\u0027s youth was that of the Third Reich but he, like his family, was fiercely opposed to the Nazi regime, and suffered imprisonment for his views. After the war, his career took him from Minister of Foreign Affairs under Willi Brandt, to the European Commission in Brussels, and then to London, where he was Director of the London School of Economics during a particularly turbulent era of its history.\n\nHe\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his academic and political career as well as his formative years in Germany; years which he believes shaped his subsequent stern and much-admired defence of libertarian principles.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Blueberry Hill by Louis Armstrong\nBook: A book of Greek poetry\nLuxury: Dice to test the luck of a ship rescuing him","first_broadcast_date":"1991-02-03T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Professor Ralf Dahrendorf"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zkh","title":"Brian Eno","first_broadcast_date":"1991-01-27T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zhp","title":"Paddy Ashdown MP","first_broadcast_date":"1991-02-10T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zjf","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfll","duration":2187,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
