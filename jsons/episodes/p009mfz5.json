It might not be the most relaxing way to mark a half-century, but Dr Owen is a passionate sailor, so the situation has its charms. He is also very keen on poetry and music, both of which will accompany him to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Piano Concerto No 21 in C - Slow Movement by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: His own anthology of poems\nLuxury: A hot bath","first_broadcast_date":"1988-07-03T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"David Owen"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mfzs","title":"Jeremy Isaacs","first_broadcast_date":"1988-06-26T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mfyc","title":"David Essex","first_broadcast_date":"1988-07-10T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mfz7","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppd0y","duration":2156,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
