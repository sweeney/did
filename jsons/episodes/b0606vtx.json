He\u0027s conducted a lot of movie scores too, including Chariots of Fire and The Talented Mr Ripley; indeed the late director Anthony Minghella described him as \u0022the UK\u0027s best kept secret\u0022.\n\nIt wasn\u0027t an illustrious start; his first job was playing sheet music for prospective customers in a Johannesburg department store - he was fired after 6 weeks. His first go at conducting was enhanced not by an elegant baton of the finest Maplewood but a rolled up old newspaper. \n\nHe\u0027s almost a hundred years old now, still plays the piano every day and only retired from the concert platform six years ago at the age of 94.\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-06-28T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Harry Rabinowitz"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b05zg6ng","title":"Stephen Fry","first_broadcast_date":"2015-06-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b060yk4m","title":"Freddie Flintoff","first_broadcast_date":"2015-07-05T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b0606n6b","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02vmglp","duration":2203,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
