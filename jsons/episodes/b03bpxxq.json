His stand-up tours do great business and his lightening sharp comedy reflexes are also put to good use on a number of prime-time panel shows.\n\nHis first ever performance was doing impressions for his school mates, but it took him more than ten years to pluck up the courage to step on stage. Leaving school with two O\u0027levels and a cheeky grin, he had a stint as Red Rum\u0027s stable boy and a bash at being a professional darts player.\n\nHe says of his comedy career \u0022I\u0027m the kind of person that, if I don\u0027t think it\u0027s hard work, I worry that it\u0027s not worthwhile. I have to feel as if I\u0027ve struggled a bit.\u0022\n\n\n\nProducer: Isabel Sargent.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-09-29T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Lee Mack"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03bg4v7","title":"Zadie Smith","first_broadcast_date":"2013-09-22T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03c2c2p","title":"Carolyn McCall","first_broadcast_date":"2013-10-06T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03bpxrb","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyhj","duration":2071,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
