He\u0027s saved hundreds of lives and counts his clients among his friends. He says his work is his calling - one he was drawn to after writing an essay on capital punishment while at school. Initially he thought it was a history essay and was appalled to find the death sentence was still in use. He planned to become a campaigning journalist, but a summer spent meeting prisoners on death row inmates convinced him that he would be able to achieve more by representing them directly. So he trained in law and set up his own legal practice to enable him to do so. He has received several awards for his work including, in 2002, the OBE.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Spem in Alium by Thomas Tallis\nBook: The Koran (in Arabic and English)\nLuxury: My computer","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-21T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Clive Stafford Smith"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093884","title":"Matthew Bourne","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-19T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009368q","title":"Tracey Emin","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009369j","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz12","duration":2036,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
