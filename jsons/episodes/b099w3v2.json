As a 12 year old growing up in British Somaliland, her dream was to build her own hospital. It took her some 50 years and all her savings to realise her ambition, and the state of the art hospital she built is a testament to her passion and dogged determination. \n\nNursing and midwifery have been her life since she won a scholarship to study in the UK in the mid-1950s, when she cycled to appointments in her black raincoat to deliver babies all around London. Married at one time to the prime minister of Somalia, she juggled the high profile role of First Lady with shifts at her local hospital. \u0022I was born with this desire to fix things,\u0022 she says.\n\nAs her country\u0027s first female foreign minister, she broke deep-rooted taboos by publicly condemning the widespread practice of female genital mutilation - FGM. Her opposition stems from personal experience - she was only eight years old when she endured the invasive procedure herself. \n\nNow 80, she lives on site at her beloved hospital, where more than 22,000 babies have been born since it opened in 2002. \n\nPresenter: Kirsty Young\nProducer: Paula McGinley.","first_broadcast_date":"2017-10-22T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Edna Adan Ismail"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b098gmsm","title":"Jane Gardam","first_broadcast_date":"2017-10-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b09bxmyb","title":"Kay Mellor","first_broadcast_date":"2017-10-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b099w1lr","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p05kcsd6","duration":2170,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
