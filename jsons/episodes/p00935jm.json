Alexander McCall Smith was an established professor of law, an expert on ethics and a part time musician when, at the age of 50, he wrote the book that turned his life on its head. The No. 1 Ladies\u0027 Detective Agency became a word of mouth best-seller. He has now written a series of books featuring Mma Precious Ramotswe, a \u0027traditionally built\u0027 Botswanan woman who spends as much time dealing with the trials of everyday life as solving crime. Her cases have included absent husbands, imposter fathers and missing children - all resolved using common sense and underpinned with a strong sense of the importance of traditional African social values.\n\nAlexander McCall Smith\u0027s fascination with, and devotion to, Africa is not surprising - he was born and brought up in Zimbabwe - then Southern Rhodesia - only moving to Britain when he began his legal studies. He visits Botswana every year. Even as a child he was a keen writer, and he was a published author for many years before he devised his most celebrated creation. His books are now printed in more than 30 languages and in 2004 he was named the Booksellers\u0027 Association Author of the Year.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Soave sia il Vento \n by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: Collection by W H Auden\nLuxury: A handmade pair of shoes","first_broadcast_date":"2005-06-19T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Alexander McCall Smith"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935jt","title":"Betsy Blair","first_broadcast_date":"2005-06-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935jf","title":"Ruby Wax","first_broadcast_date":"2005-06-26T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935jn","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0fg","duration":2082,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
