It is, perhaps, little surprise that music has been central to his life. He was born into a family that already boasted a pianist, violinist and viola player within its ranks and so, as a child, he was taught the cello because it meant they could play chamber music together. Music was so much a part of their lives, he says, that even the pet dog would howl along an accompaniment as they played. \n\nHe was seen as a brilliant young cellist but he was determined not to become a jobbing musician, touting for work in different orchestras, and as a result he suffered nearly a decade with precious few musical engagements. It was The Protecting Veil - a composition by John Tavener - that made his name and now he has become one of the world\u0027s finest cello virtuosos.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Erbarme Dich - Have Mercy Lord on Me by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: The collected works by Anthony Trollope\nLuxury: A huge, huge photo album of friends.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-02T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Steven Isserlis"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008chj2","title":"Armistead Maupin","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008fcdz","title":"Alec Jeffreys","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b008d1sj","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp03m","duration":2106,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
