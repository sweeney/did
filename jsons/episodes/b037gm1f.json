And yet she is also something of an enigma: a committed Catholic who fought hard to legalise contraception and divorce; an elected head of state with both a noble bearing and a common touch. \n\nAs a lawyer she lead from the front championing controversial causes at home in Ireland and fiercely defending human rights at the UN. She also has a habit of making history - she was Ireland\u0027s first female president and the first Irish Head of state to meet Her Majesty the Queen at Buckingham Palace.\n\nShe says of her life and work \u0022over the years I have given many talks and taken part in many discussions on leadership: women\u0027s leadership, political leadership, business leadership, grass roots leadership. But the element of leadership that really fascinates me is moral leadership.\u0022\n\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-28T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Mary Robinson"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b037524r","title":"Russell Brand","first_broadcast_date":"2013-07-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b037s4f5","title":"Eve Stewart","first_broadcast_date":"2013-08-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b037gm0r","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyjh","duration":2100,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
