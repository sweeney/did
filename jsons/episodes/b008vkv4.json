Her only ambition, she says, was to get married and have a \u0027proper\u0027 family, but when her first two children were still young, her marriage broke down and she turned to writing once again. She believes she finds inspiration from the trouble and friction of everyday life and that if her marriage hadn\u0027t failed, she would have been too happy to write another word. Now she is one of our most respected authors. She has written 17 novels and countless articles, screenplays and television plays. She\u0027s won armfuls of awards too - but, despite being shortlisted five times, she\u0027s never won the Booker prize. She doesn\u0027t mind not winning, she says, but she would like to be the writer who has had the most nominations.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Can I Forget You? by Richard Tauber\nBook: The Case Books by John Hunter\nLuxury: Pens and Paper.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-02-03T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Beryl Bainbridge"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008pdqp","title":"Rory Stewart","first_broadcast_date":"2008-01-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008wv25","title":"Oleg Gordievsky","first_broadcast_date":"2008-02-10T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b008vktq","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp02s","duration":2006,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
