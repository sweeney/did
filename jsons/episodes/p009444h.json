Twenty-five years ago she helped create Virago - the feminist publishing house which promotes women writers. A huge success, it became the focus of much attention when she and her colleague, Carmen Callil, fell out in what became a very public row. Recently, she has revamped the magazine Index on Censorship, which debates the issues surrounding freedom of speech and publishes the work of persecuted writers. The daughter of a Jewish family who fled to Britain from Nazi Germany, she was a quiet, reserved and conformist child. Her friends, she says, still wonder how she grew up to be such an outspoken, strong-minded and opinionated woman.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Der Rosenkavalier The Trio From Act Three by Richard Strauss\nBook: The collected works by Anton Chekhov\nLuxury: Family photo album","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-14T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ursula Owen"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094455","title":"Sir Frank Kermode","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-07T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009443p","title":"Mike Leigh OBE","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-21T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009444j","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfyf","duration":2186,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
