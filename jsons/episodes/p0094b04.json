Universally regarded as the \u0027grand old man of British sculpture\u0027, in the 1950s he had learnt from his mentor Henry Moore that artistic rules were there to be broken. So he yanked sculpture off it\u0027s pedestal and set it on the floor. And he rejected the traditional materials of bronze, marble and wood for girders, nuts and bolts. In fact as he confesses to Sue Lawley, nothing is safe from his magpie eye: parts of ships, cars, even kitchen equipment have all been incorporated into his work.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: String Quartet in C by Franz Schubert\nBook: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\nLuxury: Glue","first_broadcast_date":"2000-04-16T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Anthony Caro"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b0q","title":"Claire Tomalin","first_broadcast_date":"2000-04-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949zh","title":"Leonard Slatkin","first_broadcast_date":"2000-04-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094b05","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzns","duration":2090,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
