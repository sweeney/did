For 21 years he has been at the helm of Today, Radio 4\u0027s flagship news and current affairs programme. Millions of devoted listeners enjoy his tenacious interviewing style - and it\u0027s won him a healthy respect from politicians too. Not all are supporters though; Jonathan Aitken accused him of \u0022poisoning the well of democratic debate\u0022 - an attack which he initially thought would cost him his career. \n\nNow, his life is dominated not only by the alarm bell - which is set for 3.58am - but by his youngest son, Owen. When John Humphrys describes the joy and warmth the seven-year-old has brought him, he becomes, if only temporarily, lost for words.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Opening of Cello Concerto by Edward Elgar\nBook: Biggest poetry anthology possible\nLuxury: A cello.","first_broadcast_date":"2008-01-06T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Humphrys"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008hyk1","title":"Karren Brady","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008nbyy","title":"Simon Rattle","first_broadcast_date":"2008-01-13T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b008m3fl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp033","duration":2144,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
