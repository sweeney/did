He is Brian Eno, and he started his career by making music playing with tape recorders, then went on to play with bands who rehearsed far more often than they performed, graduating through to the Portsmouth Sinfonia, and ending up with the hugely successful group Roxy Music.\n\nSince his Roxy Music days, he has gone on to musical collaboration with David Bowie and production of the group U2. Brian Eno will be talking to Sue Lawley about his musical and artistic activities in the mainstream, as well as on the fringes of, international cultural life.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Lord Don\u0027t Forget About Me by Dorothy Love Coates\nBook: Contingency, Irony \u0026 Solidarity by Richard Rorty\nLuxury: Radio telescope","first_broadcast_date":"1991-01-27T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Brian Eno"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zl2","title":"Fred Zinnemann","first_broadcast_date":"1991-01-20T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zjd","title":"Professor Ralf Dahrendorf","first_broadcast_date":"1991-02-03T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zkj","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppflq","duration":2192,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
