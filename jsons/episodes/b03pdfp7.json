By the grand old age of ten she was boarding at the Yehudi Menuhin School and receiving lessons from the great man himself.\n\nHer big break came when she won the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition - the first Scot to win it. Lucrative recording contracts followed together with a hectic programme of concerts. Still only 26, she is now world-renowned as a soloist and chamber musician.\n\nOf Italian descent, her family wasn\u0027t particularly musical though the qualities of discipline, hard work and perseverance meant that fun \u0026 freedom came after music practice. Passionate about the importance of classical music in education, she walks the talk, committed to developing young musical talent through charity work and masterclasses \u0026 she received an MBE from Her Majesty the Queen for these services in 2013.\n\nShe says, \u0022when I teach seven year olds and they can play Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, I say \u0027that\u0027s amazing! Well Done!\u0027 And then occasionally Mum would remind me \u0022do you remember what you were playing at that age?\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-12T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nicola Benedetti"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03nrpc3","title":"Ray Mears","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-05T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03q56ks","title":"Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03pdfm7","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyg0","duration":2228,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
