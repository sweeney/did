Revelling in normality and drawing on the difficult, intimate and often excruciating moments of being human, she dares to say what most of us are thinking, only she\u0027s much funnier.\n\nA Geordie, born in South Shields, her dad was an engineer down the mines and her mum was a hairdresser. They encouraged their daughter in her storytelling and performing even though her childhood shyness meant she\u0027d recite her poetry from behind the living room curtains. Later it was pain that first propelled her onto the stage when a broken early marriage provided the catalyst she needed to find the courage to confront the glaring judgement of the audience\u0027s gaze. Her rise was then rapid. Within four years she was awarded the Best Newcomer prize at the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\nShe says, \u0022People come along and think, \u0027oh she\u0027s being too rude\u0027. They don\u0027t realise I\u0027m just like this at home. People think I\u0027m prim and proper at home but I\u0027m not - I\u0027m just me transplanted onto the stage\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-14T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sarah Millican"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04tckjf","title":"Julie Bentley","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04vd69f","title":"The Most Reverend Justin Welby","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04v2kxl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny9n","duration":2098,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
