Before she was 30, she hadn\u0027t so much as walked with a rucksack and had no experience of navigating with a compass. Then her husband saw a newspaper advert seeking ordinary women to join an all-women relay to the North Pole. Ann was successful and since then she has walked to both Poles, become a Polar guide and now has her sights set on being the first British woman to walk solo to the North Pole - an endeavour she\u0027ll attempt for the second time this March. \n\nWhile she is on her expeditions, the life she leaves behind is also far from routine - she is a mother to four children including triplets. She has met some criticism for leaving her children for long periods, but she responds by saying that they are her inspiration - she wants to demonstrate to them how to live life to the full.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) by Eurythmics\nBook: The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard\nLuxury: A bar of soap","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-21T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ann Daniels"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tr3","title":"Edna O\u0027Brien","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-14T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093tnd","title":"Brian Aldiss","first_broadcast_date":"2007-01-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093tqm","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp07k","duration":2079,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
