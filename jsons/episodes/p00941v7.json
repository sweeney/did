Long before the existence of the Internet, he wrote about \u0027cyberspace\u0027, a boundless world reached only through computers. External space travel, to the Moon and Mars, had become old hat. By creating internal space, he breathed new life into science fiction. In conversation with Sue Lawley, he talks about his life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: (Are You) The One That I\u0027ve Been Waiting For? by Nick Cave\nBook: Complete Works  by Jorge Luis Borges\nLuxury: Junk yard","first_broadcast_date":"1999-11-19T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"William Gibson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00941vr","title":"Willard White","first_broadcast_date":"1999-11-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00941tb","title":"Clarissa Dickson Wright","first_broadcast_date":"1999-11-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00941v9","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfng","duration":2098,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
