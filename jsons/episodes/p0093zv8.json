Very much a man of the arts, and a determined apostle of all things new, he founded the University Opera Society when he was at Cambridge and the London Sinfonietta when he left. He then moved to Paris, where he was appointed Artistic Director of the Pompidou Centre.\n\nHis latest post at the South Bank has attracted considerable controversy, with one critic describing his concert programme as \u0022seriously unattractive\u0022. He\u0027ll be discussing his vision of the South Bank\u0027s musical future with Sue Lawley and talking about his achievement of establishing, for the first time, a resident orchestra in Britain\u0027s largest arts centre.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]  \n\nFavourite track: String Quintet No 4 In G Minor by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: Smiley\u0027s People by John Le Carre\nLuxury: Coffee machine","first_broadcast_date":"1990-10-28T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Nicholas Snowman"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093zvy","title":"Ernie Wise","first_broadcast_date":"1990-10-21T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093ztk","title":"Lord Annan","first_broadcast_date":"1990-11-04T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093zv9","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcn0","duration":2102,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
