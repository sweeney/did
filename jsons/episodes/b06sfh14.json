Over the decades the storylines have followed her character through one marriage, four children and since 2010, widowhood.\n\nBorn in Derby in 1931, Paddy\u0027s love of acting began early on inspired by her father who was a keen amateur actor. As an only and independent child she was surrounded by the adult world and would often eavesdrop as she hid under the kitchen table. Her parents loved entertainment and would take her to the cinema every week to see Hollywood romances or comedies.\n\nAfter attending a grammar school she went to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London in 1951. She wanted to be a classical actress, but then a phone call from the Archers production office changed her career path and she joined the cast initially on a six week contract in 1957. Her character Jill went onto marry the farmer Phil Archer, and is still there with a recent storyline seeing her return to Brookfield, the family farm.\n\nPatricia has been married twice and was widowed in 1986. She was awarded an MBE in 2007.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-27T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Patricia Greene"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06s7y34","title":"Commander Chris Hadfield","first_broadcast_date":"2015-12-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06tq3th","title":"Colm Toibin","first_broadcast_date":"2016-01-03T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06sff0z","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p03chkd5","duration":2186,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
