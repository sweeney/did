His 1984 production of Sade\u0027s debut album, \u0027Diamond Life\u0027, was named one of the best ten albums of the last thirty years at the 2010 Brit Awards.\n\nHe experienced problems with his eyesight from birth, especially in the dark, and had tunnel vision. Aged 16, a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa was confirmed and he was told that he would eventually lose his sight completely. On leaving school he studied law at Cambridge before becoming a music producer. The production of Sade\u0027s second album coincided with the loss of his remaining sight. In 2012 he underwent a retina implant which gave him some sight but the success was brief and later his body rejected it.\n\nHe works with a number of charities, mentors young musicians and was given a CBE for services to music in 2010.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-03-15T11:16:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Robin Millar"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b054pbb3","title":"Bryan Stevenson","first_broadcast_date":"2015-03-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b05mpx0h","title":"Pat Albeck","first_broadcast_date":"2015-03-22T11:16:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b055dww2","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny87","duration":2086,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
