A life of minor crime followed until he joined the infantry with the Royal Green Jackets in 1976 progressing to the SAS. In the Gulf War, McNab commanded the Bravo Two Zero patrol, given the task of destroying underground communication links in Iraq and mobile Scud launchers. Three of the eight-man patrol were killed, one escaped and four were taken prisoner by the Iraqis and tortured over a six-week period. He\u0027s been awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal and was the British Army\u0027s most highly decorated serving soldier when he left the SAS in 1993. His book Bravo Two Zero became a bestseller and this was followed by his autobiography Immediate Action. Since then, he\u0027s published seven novels about a former soldier who then works for British Intelligence.\n\nElements of this programme may offend or upset some listeners.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Sweet Thing\n by David Bowie\nBook: Any book by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: A gollock","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-09T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Andy McNab"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093652","title":"Carlos Acosta","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009363r","title":"Sam Taylor-Wood","first_broadcast_date":"2005-01-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009387b","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0gw","duration":2085,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
