This led to guest appearances in a series on the Light Programme, and so his career took off. Before long he also took up the lute and played his part in the revival of interest in early music. In conversation with Roy Plomley, he talks about his long career and chooses the eight records he would take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]","first_broadcast_date":"1983-07-09T18:25:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Julian Bream"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mjgt","title":"Terry Jones","first_broadcast_date":"1983-07-02T18:25:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mjf8","title":"Sir John Pritchard","first_broadcast_date":"1983-07-16T18:25:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mjg3","duration":3300,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppggr","duration":1969,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
