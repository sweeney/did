An intensely shy and private person, renowned for her powerfully emotional songs, she\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her first impressions of England when she arrived here as a small girl 31 years ago from the Caribbean. She\u0027ll also be discussing her music, and the fame which it has brought - something she still finds surprising, and often quite overwhelming.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Madame George by Van Morrison\nBook: Why Didn\u0027t They Ask Evans? by Agatha Christie\nLuxury: Guitar","first_broadcast_date":"1989-01-29T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Joan Armatrading"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mf71","title":"Boy George","first_broadcast_date":"1989-01-22T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mf5k","title":"Rocco Forte","first_broadcast_date":"1989-02-05T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mf6b","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcxp","duration":2112,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
