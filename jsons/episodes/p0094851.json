Then he suffered a stroke and lost the use of his left arm, but by adapting the music they continued to perform together successfully in Britain and abroad. In conversation with Sue Lawley, she talks about her life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Serenade To Music (Excerpt) by Vaughan Williams\nBook: The Oxford Companion to Music\nLuxury: Clockwork radio tuned to Radio 4","first_broadcast_date":"2002-01-27T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Phyllis Sellick"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009485z","title":"Bob Worcester","first_broadcast_date":"2002-01-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094844","title":"David Linley","first_broadcast_date":"2002-02-03T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094854","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzfh","duration":2197,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
