Since his first book, Mind Your Own Business, was published more than than 30 years ago, he has been credited with revolutionising the way children\u0027s poems are written and performed. Words and language have always formed an important part of his life. The son of two teachers, he was born into a London, Jewish family, and brought up in a home full of literature, conversation and debate. His poems often rely on snatches of dialogue and memories from his own childhood and relate his experiences with his own children. \n\nHis greatest commercial success has been his hugely popular re-telling of the American folk tale We\u0027re All Going on a Bear Hunt. More recently he\u0027s published a series of memories aimed at adults rather than children. In particular, these attend to the central tragedy of his life, the sudden death of his second son Eddie, when he was 18 years old. His death became a public matter because Eddie had featured so often in Michael\u0027s early work and was a well-known character to millions of children.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Black, Brown and White by Big Bill Broonzy\nBook: The Complete Poems by Carl Sandburg\nLuxury: A didgeridoo belonging to his late son Eddie.","first_broadcast_date":"2006-08-06T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Michael Rosen"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093v9l","title":"David Edgar","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093v6h","title":"Simon Cowell","first_broadcast_date":"2006-08-13T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093v8q","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp09l","duration":2089,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
