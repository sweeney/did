Her books have shone a piercing light on the veiled world of shame, brutality and coercion that some young women endure whilst Karma Nirvana, the pioneering charity she set up and runs, offers refuge and practical help.\n\nShe says, \u0022my life has had to take paths where responsibility was the key thing. Now I\u0027m at a point in my life where I\u0027m more content than I\u0027ve ever been. I\u0027ve reconciled the disownment.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-24T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jasvinder Sanghera"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01r95hg","title":"Julie Goodyear","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-17T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01rl0z9","title":"Sir Sydney Kentridge","first_broadcast_date":"2013-03-31T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01rfxgt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"b01rky2g","duration":2400,"types":["Shortened"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnykz","duration":2066,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
