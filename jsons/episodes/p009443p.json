He first came to public attention on a dark and stormy evening when 16 million people tuned to BBC1 to watch his film Abigail\u0027s Party. It was also the night that ITV was blacked out by a strike, there was a highbrow documentary on BBC2, and Channel 4 didn\u0027t exist. His recent films Secrets and Lies and Naked won top awards at Cannes, building on the recognition he received for his earlier, more gentle portrait of working-class life - Life is Sweet. He explains to Sue Lawley how his early films were inspired by the work of Harold Pinter, Samuel Beckett and Francois Truffaut. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Clarinet Concerto in A Clarinet Concerto in A Major K622 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez\nLuxury: Lavatory and lavatory paper","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-21T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Mike Leigh OBE"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009444h","title":"Ursula Owen","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-14T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009442z","title":"Peter O\u0027Sullevan","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-28T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009443r","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfyc","duration":2227,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
