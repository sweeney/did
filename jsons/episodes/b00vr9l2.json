Then he got a grant, chucked in his job and devoted himself to writing and performing. \n\nThese days he\u0027s known as the Bard of Barnsley and his appeal stretches from the terraces of his local football club to the balcony of the London Coliseum... he is poet in residence at both Barnsley FC and the English National Opera... \n\nHe still lives in the village where he was born and he considers and analyses British culture from his very particular vantage point in south Yorkshire. \n\nHe says: \u0022You can do the universal in the local, I always think. You can see all the changes that have happened all over the world in the 20th and 21st centuries in microcosm.\u0022 \n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle\n\nRecord: 4\u0027 33\u0022 - John Cage\nBook: The Long and The Short of It: Poems 1955-2005 by Roy Fisher \nLuxury: A tandem bike with wooden models of his family on the front.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-11-07T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ian McMillan"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00vknrn","title":"Lang Lang","first_broadcast_date":"2010-10-31T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00vy3rr","title":"Anna Del Conte","first_broadcast_date":"2010-11-19T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00vr9kt","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyzg","duration":2240,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
