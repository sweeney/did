He is that rare and apparently contradictory thing - a character actor and a superstar. \n\nThe Graduate, Midnight Cowboy, Lenny, All The President\u0027s Men, Marathon Man, Kramer v Kramer, Tootsie, Rain Man, Wag The Dog, and Last Chance Harvey are just a handful of the movies that contribute to an unparalleled body of work: he is the only actor in history to have top billing in three films that won Best Picture Oscars. \n\nNow in his mid-70s he is making his directorial debut.\n\nHe says \u0022I\u0027m always fighting to break through... I\u0027m trying to show you the part of me that wants to love, wants to kill, that wants to find my way out, that feels there is no way out.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-02T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Dustin Hoffman"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01p067p","title":"Edmund de Waal","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01p6ryx","title":"Rt Hon Eric Pickles MP","first_broadcast_date":"2012-12-09T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01p30jh","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnymt","duration":2176,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
