During the 30 years he has been in the business, some of Britain\u0027s most eminent modern playwrights - John Mortimer, Alan Ayckbourn and Tom Stoppard for example - started their writing careers under his patronage. He\u0027s also turned his hand to popular entertainment in the form of hit plays like Crown Matrimonial and There\u0027s a Girl in my Soup. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about his successes as well as his failures, and the risky but compulsive character of show business life.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Symphony No 1 in C by Georges Bizet\nBook: Caroline and Charlotte by Alison Plowman\nLuxury: Jigsaw puzzles","first_broadcast_date":"1989-11-12T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Michael Codron"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mdfs","title":"Ian Botham","first_broadcast_date":"1989-11-05T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mdcy","title":"Seamus Heaney","first_broadcast_date":"1989-11-19T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mdf3","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppct3","duration":2170,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
