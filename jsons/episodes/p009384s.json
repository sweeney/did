He is the most celebrated and successful composer of carols alive today and this Christmas his music will be heard in concerts and churches all over the world. He is drawn to the simplicity of Christmas carols and says he loves being able to compose \u0027a hummable tune\u0027. \n\nInspired and encouraged by his school education, he became Director of Music at Clare College, Cambridge, and then with a string of winning commissions already behind him, moved into full time composition. But his relationship with composition is a difficult one - it\u0027s a process he finds isolating and says that although it does not make him happy - he feels compelled to do it. However, once he has finished a work he says nothing in the world compares with the feeling he experiences when he conducts it for the first time. He says: \u0022I write music that people will enjoy singing. I\u0027m not ashamed of that\u0022.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Gloria in Excelsis Deo from B Minor Mass by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: Teach yourself mathematics illustrated by voluptuous women\nLuxury:  Viola","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-25T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Rutter"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009385k","title":"Maggi Hambling","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093w2b","title":"Kelly Holmes","first_broadcast_date":"2006-01-01T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009384t","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0d1","duration":2213,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
