Within two weeks of meeting the composer Sir William Walton, Susana Gil Passo had accepted his marriage proposal and left her home in Argentina. When they moved to the island of Ischia, she began transforming the barren land into what is now La Mortella - one of the most famous and beautiful gardens of the Mediterranean. It boasts more than 600 exotic plants - including tree ferns, jacaranda and the huge Victoria Amazonica Waterlily - and is the backdrop to summer concerts organised in Sir William\u0027s memory. In conversation with Sue Lawley, she talks about her life and work and chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Troilus and Cressida, Act Two by Sir William Walton\nBook: The Education of a Gardener by Russel Page\nLuxury: Downy pillow","first_broadcast_date":"2002-01-13T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Susana Walton"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009487n","title":"Sir Peter Morris","first_broadcast_date":"2002-01-06T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009485z","title":"Bob Worcester","first_broadcast_date":"2002-01-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009486v","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzfq","duration":2235,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
