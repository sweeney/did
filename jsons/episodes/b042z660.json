That is only part of the picture: even though show business was in the family - his great grandparents were in music hall - his early working life ranged all over the place. From grafting in the kitchens of The Ritz to working in an artificial leg factory - at one point he even seriously considered the priesthood.\n\nHe says his caustic, ironic, sarcastic comedy comes from \u0022a sort of realism. You can\u0027t escape the dark stuff in life ... and my way of dealing with that is to absorb it into my life so that it\u0027s no longer worrying for me.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-11T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Jack Dee"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03z3l2g","title":"Sir Andre Geim","first_broadcast_date":"2014-03-30T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b043wk0j","title":"Alison Moyet","first_broadcast_date":"2014-05-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b042z40w","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnydr","duration":2083,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
