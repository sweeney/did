Her roles included Lady Macbeth and Ibsen\u0027s Hedda Gabler. \n\nShe had five children in relatively quick succession and continued acting on TV and the London stage, often putting her youngest in a pram and going in the guard\u0027s van on the train to the theatre.\n\nThroughout her time on EastEnders she has occasionally ventured away to direct or take part in other television series. In 2009 she stripped down to nothing as Jessie in the stage production Calendar Girls.
