He has performed in concert halls the world over under the batons of the finest conductors and, while he made his name as a Lieder singer, he\u0027s equally popular for his jazz, spiritual and gospel recordings. \n\nMusic critics say he is \u0022one of the great singers of our time and one of the most remarkable of any time.\u0022 That his life has been remarkable is a reference to his disability: he was born suffering the effects of Thalidomide and although his early musical talent was spotted, his inability to play the piano meant he was not allowed to take up a place at a conservatoire.\n\nIn this candid and moving interview, though, he describes how, with his family\u0027s support, he went on to build a highly successful career. Now, living contentedly with his wife and daughter, he says his life is a full and satisfying one. He adds that when he sees how readily people become consumed by envy and resentment, he questions whether that too isn\u0027t a kind of disability.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Adagietto from 5th symphony by Gustav Mahler\nBook: Long Walk to Freedom  by Nelson Mandela\nLuxury: Good wine.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-01T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Thomas Quasthoff"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00gsv4l","title":"Alan Sillitoe","first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00h9vcx","title":"David Suchet","first_broadcast_date":"2009-02-08T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00h4cgl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzy5","duration":2195,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
