Blofeld\u0027s become known as much for his musings on pigeons, planes, double decker buses, tea ladies, cakes and his catchphrase \u0027my dear old thing\u0027 as he is for his cricket commentary. \n\nAs a teenager he showed great promise as a cricketer and was even thought good enough to play for England until his dreams were dashed after a serious accident when his bike hit a bus. He dropped out of Cambridge and toyed with the idea of a career in merchant banking before realising his true vocation. Advised in his early years to \u0027paint a picture\u0027 for his listeners, \u0027Blowers\u0027 has since gone on to become a much-loved stalwart of the Test Match Special team. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Cricket commentary by Brian Johnston, Jonathan Agnew, John Arlott\nBook: A Pelican at Blandings by P G Wodehouse\nLuxury: Personal photo album","first_broadcast_date":"2003-11-30T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Henry Blofeld"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00938j9","title":"Sir Christopher Meyer","first_broadcast_date":"2003-11-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009374t","title":"Pat Barker","first_broadcast_date":"2003-12-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009375z","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyj6","duration":2158,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz4r","duration":2154,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
