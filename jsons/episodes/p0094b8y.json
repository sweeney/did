As a child he would cycle past Bram Stoker\u0027s house on his way to school, one of the reasons, perhaps, that he went on to direct the film Interview with a Vampire. His other movies include Mona Lisa and The Butcher Boy; the story of a little Irish lad who talks to the Virgin Mary which has echoes in his own Irish Catholic childhood.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Round Midnight by Thelonious Monk\nBook: A la Recherche du Temps Perdu by Marcel Proust\nLuxury: Typewriter","first_broadcast_date":"2000-01-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Neil Jordan"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b9p","title":"Ian McEwan","first_broadcast_date":"2000-01-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094b85","title":"Peter Melchett","first_broadcast_date":"2000-01-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094b8z","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzpx","duration":2150,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
