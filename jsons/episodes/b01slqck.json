It was there, aged 7, two floors above a fish and chip shop and a row of amusements arcades - and having practiced \u0022good toes, bad toes\u0022 - that she knew precisely what she wanted to do with her life.\n\nAfter many years of success at the top of her profession, she said goodbye to her childhood dream and jet\u00e9d into her life\u0027s next act - for a time serving as Creative Director of The Royal Opera House and more recently working far beyond Covent Garden promoting creativity and cultural partnerships across Britain.\n\nShe says \u0022I always thought I\u0027d feel a passionate sense of loss when I stopped dancing. What was absolutely wonderful was, as the volume turned up on the new career, the volume turned down on the old one.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2013-05-26T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Deborah Bull"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01shstm","title":"Alice Walker","first_broadcast_date":"2013-05-19T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b02116z9","title":"Sir Mervyn King","first_broadcast_date":"2013-06-02T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01slpyx","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnykj","duration":2175,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
