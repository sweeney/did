Her political awakening came in her teens in the 1970s against the backdrop of the National Front and race riots in the capital. The bands she listened to, including the Clash, the Jam and the Specials, were fixtures at the Rock Against Racism concerts which galvanised her desire to make a difference.\n\nBend it Like Beckham, which launched the career of Keira Knightly, is now a hit musical on the West End stage. Her next film, Viceroy\u0027s House, tackles the Partition of India in 1947.\n\nShe was awarded an OBE in the 2006 Queen\u0027s Birthday Honours List for her services to the British Film Industry.\n\n\nProducer: Paula McGinley.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-11-22T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Gurinder Chadha"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06p4nph","title":"Rt Hon Nicola Sturgeon","first_broadcast_date":"2015-11-15T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b06qg1ls","title":"Sandi Toksvig","first_broadcast_date":"2015-11-29T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b06ps64c","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p038j8kz","duration":1956,"types":["Podcast version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p038mzfs","duration":1962,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
