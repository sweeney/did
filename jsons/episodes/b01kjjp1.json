Her life off the court has been equally eventful - she grew up in communist Czechoslovakia and, as a teenager, threw rocks as Soviet tanks rolled in; tennis offered a way to see the world and she defected to the US when she was 18 years old. After thirty years at the top of her profession she retired - and says she finally found time for the rest of her life: \u0022Tennis really was a total commitment, you didn\u0027t have much time for anything else. So, when I quit, I was going through something emotionally that most people go through when they\u0027re 18, 20 years old. Really having the time for personal relationships, developing friendships and taking the time with everybody. I think I\u0027ve caught up by now.\u0022\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-08T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Martina Navratilova"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01k9n81","title":"Charles Jencks","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-01T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01kr7q1","title":"Simon McBurney","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-15T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01kjhxx","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnypk","duration":2252,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
