Regarded as one of the \u0027great social satirists of his era\u0027, he made his name with his Tales of the City novels, chronicling the shifting cultural landscape of San Francisco throughout the 1970s and 80s. He\u0027s written about the search for love and acceptance by a diverse cast of characters, but he was also one of the first novelists to portray the devastating impact of the newly emerging threat of HIV\/Aids.\n\nHis iconic status as a gay writer and political activist couldn\u0027t be further from his background, growing up in the genteel American South, with a \u0027neo-fascist, arch-conservative\u0027 father. Armistead tells Kirsty about his transition to the other end of the political spectrum, and how his life has become inseparable from his work.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The reprise of Wicked Little Town by Tommy Gnosis\nBook: The Cole Porter Songbook by Cole Porter\nLuxury: Vaporiser.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-25T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Armistead Maupin"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00898xv","title":"Eliza Manningham-Buller","first_broadcast_date":"2007-11-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008d1y8","title":"Steven Isserlis","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b008cgdp","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp03r","duration":2029,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
