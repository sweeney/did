She\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her reaction to the ecstatic reception given to her first CD, how she lived a life of obscurity working in a bank after she abandoned her career and about her life in pre-revolution Russia, where she and her family nearly starved to death before fleeing to England. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Symphony No 9 Final Movement by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: A culinary book\nLuxury: Peanuts and treats to tame animals and birds","first_broadcast_date":"1996-03-24T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Kyra Vayne"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nqw","title":"Lord Alexander","first_broadcast_date":"1996-03-17T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093nph","title":"Simon Weston","first_broadcast_date":"1996-03-31T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093nq5","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppdqd","duration":2195,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
