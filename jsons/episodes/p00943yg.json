Closely associated with Venice, he talks about his love for the city and his battle to protect it from the rising waters of the Mediterranean. It\u0027s a passion he learnt from his parents - the diplomat and politician Duff Cooper and the beautiful socialite Lady Diana. As a boy he grew up surrounded by his mother\u0027s friends - artists and writers like Jean Cocteau and Noel Coward. Evelyn Waugh, too, frequently visited. But he was someone who his mother adored and his father barely tolerated.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Bassoon Concerto in B by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon\nLuxury: Laptop Computer","first_broadcast_date":"1997-11-02T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Julius Norwich"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943z4","title":"Richard Mabey","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-26T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943xn","title":"Anthony Minghella","first_broadcast_date":"1997-11-09T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943yl","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfxx","duration":2194,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
