What follows is what was said about the programme at the time:\n\nSue Lawley\u0027s castaway this week has celebrated more than 50 years as a professional performer - he\u0027s the comedian and singer Harry Secombe.\n\nAt 76, he can still hit the cruel Cs, although these days he turns puce with the effort. He can still make an audience laugh itself silly and numbers Prince Charles among his many fans. He\u0027s most definitely the best raspberry-blower in the business. Today he recalls the early days of The Goon Show with Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Michael Bentine. He remembers the nights spent in review alongside those Windmill girls dressed only in beads - \u0022and most of those were sweat\u0022. And he describes how presenting Highway and Songs of Praise has left him feeling humble.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Fantasia On Greensleeves by Ralph Vaughan Williams\nBook: The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens\nLuxury: Guitar","first_broadcast_date":"1997-12-21T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Harry Secombe"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943ty","title":"Chris Haskins","first_broadcast_date":"1997-12-14T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943rz","title":"Glenda Jackson MP","first_broadcast_date":"1997-12-28T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943t1","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfxc","duration":2143,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
