If the comedy work ever dries up he could open a shop selling second hand Baftas - he\u0027s won a stack of them and a Grammy and an Emmy.\n\nWhich isn\u0027t to say it\u0027s been an easy ride - fall outs, multiple sackings and missed opportunities have peppered his stellar career in comedy. He says, \n\n\u0022I like starting things ... there are starters and finishers in life, that\u0027s the great divide ... I like the fight and the passion and the difficulty - well I don\u0027t like it, but it\u0027s what I do\u0022.\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-18T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"John Lloyd"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01ntlrs","title":"Blanche Marvin","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-16T09:00:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01p067p","title":"Edmund de Waal","first_broadcast_date":"2012-11-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01nx2g7","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyn3","duration":2118,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
