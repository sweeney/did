An American, he is about to take on the mantle of chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. \n\nRenouned for his championing of both the American and British cannons, his aim has always been to demystify music of all kinds. He has spun discs on a pirate radio station and played honky tonk piano in a jazz bar. His parents\u0027 Hollywood String Quartet was the best known band in town and the Slatkin household was often filled with film stars.
