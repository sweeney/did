He has lampooned news journalism with his creations On the Hour and The Day Today and plumbed the shallows of the chat show circuit through the vain and insecure Alan Partridge. His most recent work has been more biting: his Westminster satire The Thick of It dissects the relationship between politicians, their spin-doctors and the media they want to control. Decisions are made on the hoof, in haste and in response to media pressure - there\u0027s not a politician, civil servant or journalist who isn\u0027t compromised in the process. \n\nA highly academic child at a Jesuit school, in his teens he harboured ambitions to become a Catholic priest. His parents thought he might become a doctor or lawyer, but after getting a first-class degree from Oxford, and spending three years writing a thesis about religious language with reference to Milton, he concentrated on comedy instead. He joined the BBC and ended up producing the radio comedy programmes he had listened to as a child. \n\nHe is currently involved in developing new comedy for the BBC and is this year\u0027s Visiting Professor of Broadcast Media at Oxford University.\n\nThis programme includes language which may offend some listeners.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Opening of Mahler\u0027s 9th Symphony by Gustav Mahler\nBook: Complete Short Stories by H G Wells\nLuxury: Virtual sherry trifle","first_broadcast_date":"2006-06-04T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Armando Iannucci"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vjz","title":"Rt Hon David Cameron MP","first_broadcast_date":"2006-05-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vhv","title":"George Davies","first_broadcast_date":"2006-06-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vjg","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0bl","duration":2214,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
