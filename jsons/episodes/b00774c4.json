For more than 20 years his work was broadly unknown outside the narrow confines of the art world. But in 2003 he became a household name after a collection of his exquisitely ornate pots won him art\u0027s most prestigious award, the Turner Prize. He\u0027s described as \u0027the hottest potter in the world\u0027 but newspaper headlines describing his success focused at least as much on his clothes as his art - when he collected the prize he wore a lilac party dress with a bow in his hair.\n\nHe started dressing in his sister\u0027s clothes when he was a child - initially as part of his imaginative games and then for an erotic thrill. In part, women\u0027s clothes represented the tender emotions he was too scared to show in his repressive and sometimes frightening family home. Now, they\u0027re a way of controlling how people see him, what kind of attention he attracts and, if nothing else, they\u0027re a unique selling point. He acknowledges the debt he owes to his profession; only the arts would tolerate, he says, a transvestite potter from Essex.\n\nFavourite track: Prophecies by Philip Glass\nBook: An art book on Gothic and Renaissance altar pieces\nLuxury: Loads of really good pens and paper","first_broadcast_date":"2007-02-18T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Grayson Perry"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007742c","title":"Paul Abbott","first_broadcast_date":"2007-02-11T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00774n5","title":"Andrew Neil","first_broadcast_date":"2007-02-25T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b006vyk1","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp075","duration":2073,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
