She is a highly acclaimed writer who is fascinated with the natural world around her. She\u0027s said of her poetry: \u0022wildness, and wild animals lie at the heart of what I feel about writing\u0022. And perhaps that\u0027s no surprise - she is the great-great-granddaughter of Charles Darwin. \n\nAs a child, her hero was Bagheera - the black panther from The Jungle Book. For a time, she confesses, she used to want to be a black panther. Later, she simply wanted to marry one. As an adult she has spent several years travelling across India, Sumatra and parts of Russia tracking tigers and trying to understand their lives. She notes ruefully that while her illustrious ancestor was involved in understanding how different species came into being, her own work was more a matter of documenting their decline. \n\nHer interests have been with her since childhood. Back then, she says, \u0022looking at nature properly, knowing the names of the plants, seeing how the petals worked, observing animal behaviour was just there. That was what you did. That was what being a person was.\u0022\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: E Voi Ridete? - And you\u0027re laughing? by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nBook: The Iliad by Homer\nLuxury: A lot of paper and pencils.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-11T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ruth Padel"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00g9cjd","title":"Simon Murray","first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00gq4n2","title":"Vincent Cable MP","first_broadcast_date":"2009-01-18T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00ghq0h","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzyd","duration":2165,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
