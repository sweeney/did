Katharine Whitehorn was the first journalist to write a column about her personal and domestic life and draw broader truths from her experiences - it\u0027s the kind of material that is now commonly found on women\u0027s pages and is satirised in Private Eye\u0027s Polly Filler - but in the 1950s and 1960s it was a new phenomenon and she was its brightest and wittiest exponent. \n\nShe came to journalism through a circuitous route that took in Picture Post, Woman\u0027s Own and The Spectator, but it was on the Observer - where she worked for more than 30 years - that she really made her mark. She was at the vanguard of a generation of women who were told they could \u0027have it all\u0027 and she may even be the only one to have managed it - a successful, well-paid career, a happy marriage and complete family. While at the Picture Post she met Gavin Lyall - who went on to become a successful novelist - they had two sons and were married for 45 years until his death in 2002. She is now the agony aunt for Saga Magazine.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Slow movement of Double Violin Concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach\nBook: A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson\nLuxury: A machine to distil whatever is there","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-01T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Katharine Whitehorn"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935rv","title":"Jarvis Cocker","first_broadcast_date":"2005-04-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935pv","title":"Josephine Cox","first_broadcast_date":"2005-05-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935qm","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0fy","duration":2118,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
