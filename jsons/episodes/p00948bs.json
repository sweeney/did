Those early ambitions were not misplaced; in the last 20 years Sir Cameron has produced a string of hits - from Cats and Miss Saigon to Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables and My Fair Lady. He is Sue Lawley\u0027s castaway on Desert Island Discs this week.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Pie Jesu (from Requiem) (1985) by Andrew Lloyd Webber \nBook: Complete Cookery Course by Delia Smith\nLuxury: Solar-powered Magimix","first_broadcast_date":"2001-12-09T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Cameron Mackintosh"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00948cn","title":"Rt Hon William Hague MP","first_broadcast_date":"2001-12-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00948b0","title":"Anne Fine","first_broadcast_date":"2001-12-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00948bw","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzgd","duration":2014,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
