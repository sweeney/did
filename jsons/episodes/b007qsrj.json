In just twelve episodes, his show The Office changed the face of British television comedy. At its centre was the comic monster, David Brent, a middle-manager being filmed for a mock-documentary who saw the ever-present cameras as his route to popularity and fame. Ricky Gervais\u0027s performance was both excruciating and unmissable - one critic called the programme \u0022among the most affecting and invigorating works of fiction since the turn of the century\u0022. \n\nAs he discusses with Kirsty Young, comedy was the language he grew up with - the youngest of four children, being able to come up with a gag or a smart rejoinder was the linguistic currency of his home. That, he says, is where the \u0027show-off performer\u0027 was born. Now with seven Baftas, two Golden Globes and an Emmy to his name, Ricky Gervais is gratified that his work is recognised and says his aim has always been to bring art into comedy.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Lilywhite by Cat Stevens\nBook: A coffee table book of art\nLuxury: Vat of novocaine - a non-addictive pain-killer.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-06-24T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ricky Gervais"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007ptxs","title":"Christy Moore","first_broadcast_date":"2007-06-17T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007rd3j","title":"Wangari Maathai","first_broadcast_date":"2007-07-01T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b007qsq7","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp05r","duration":2008,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
