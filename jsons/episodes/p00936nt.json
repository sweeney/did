He styles himself as a \u0027story-teller\/writer\u0027 and the themes he explores are the relationships between young and old, children and animals and children\u0027s experiences of loneliness and self-reliance. \nHe was initially planning on a career in the military and trained at Sandhurst, but a change of direction led him to study English at university and become a teacher and then, when he was aware his class were bored with a book he was reading to them, started telling them his own stories. \n\nTogether with his wife, Clare, he set up the charity Farms for City Children in Devon to give inner-city children the opportunity to experience life on a farm, working with animals and being close to nature. The charity now has three farms and they have been visited by more than 30,000 children. He is the third Children\u0027s Laureate and says he is devoted to giving children a love of books and reading. His own works include War Horse, Kensuke\u0027s Kingdom, Why the Wales Came and, most recently, Private Peaceful. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Spem In Alium by Thomas Tallis\nBook: The Rattlebag: An Anthology of Poetry by Ted Hughes\nLuxury: Waterslide","first_broadcast_date":"2004-04-11T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Michael Morpurgo"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936pm","title":"Angela Gheorghiu","first_broadcast_date":"2004-04-04T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936mt","title":"Bernard Cornwell","first_broadcast_date":"2004-04-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936nz","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz2x","duration":2174,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
