Until recently he was something of a curiosity - a big businessman who was also a lifelong supporter of Labour and enthusiastically pro-Europe. It was the Aldermaston marches in the late 1950s which influenced his political beliefs. Sent to report on them for the Irish Times, he was soon swept along by the protesters\u0027 enthusiasm and sense of purpose.\n\nIt was then too he learnt his organisational skills. When put in charge of sorting out accommodation for thousands of extra marchers, he fled to the pub. By the time he returned they had gone. Problem solved. He joined Northern Foods after falling in love with the owners\u0027 daughter. At that time, it was a small company providing milk for doorstep deliveries. Today, it\u0027s one of Britain\u0027s biggest food companies.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Symphony No 9 In D Minor Adagio by Ludwig van Beethoven\nBook: The collected works by Sean O\u0027Casey\nLuxury: Pen and paper","first_broadcast_date":"1997-12-14T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Chris Haskins"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943vs","title":"Paula Rego","first_broadcast_date":"1997-12-07T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943sz","title":"Sir Harry Secombe","first_broadcast_date":"1997-12-21T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00943tz","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfxf","duration":2069,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
