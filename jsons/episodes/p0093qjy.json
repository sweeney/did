The son of a jockey who had won the Grand National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup - Scu, as he is known throughout the racing fraternity - resisted all attempts to turn him into an estate agent, and followed in his father\u0027s footsteps. Having broken nearly every bone in his body, he retired in 1993 after a career which encompassed 1,678 National Hunt victories and the title of Champion Jockey a record eight times. He\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about jockeys, jumping and his new career, journalism.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Laid by James\nBook: Book of Verse by Rudyard Kipling\nLuxury: Snorkeling equipment","first_broadcast_date":"1994-05-29T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Peter Scudamore"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qkm","title":"Britt Ekland","first_broadcast_date":"1994-05-22T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093qjc","title":"Milton Shulman","first_broadcast_date":"1994-06-05T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093qk0","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppf14","duration":2034,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
