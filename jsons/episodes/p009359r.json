The presenter once known as a scourge of the Establishment has become something of an establishment figure himself, noted for his formidable contacts book, his star-studded parties, and for his gentle but revealing interviewing style.\n \nBorn in 1939, the youngest son of a Methodist minister and his wife, David was football and cricket-mad from an early age but with a burning ambition to go to Cambridge University. He arrived there in 1958, and threw himself into it, joining Footlights and editing Varsity and Granta. After Cambridge, Ned Sherrin saw him performing a comedy act in a Mayfair bar and hired him up to present the iconic satirical programme That Was The Week That Was. Other successful programmes followed including Frost Over Britain and The Frost Report. \n\nBreakfast with Frost ran for twelve years until early 2005. David is not retiring though and is due to present a new interview programme for Al-Jazeera International which will begin next Spring, and will also conduct occasional interviews for the BBC.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Dam Busters by Eric Coates\nBook: London A-Z\nLuxury: Sunday papers","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-27T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir David Frost"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009386c","title":"Mary Midgley","first_broadcast_date":"2005-11-20T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009359k","title":"Colin Firth","first_broadcast_date":"2005-12-04T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009359s","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0d9","duration":2126,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
