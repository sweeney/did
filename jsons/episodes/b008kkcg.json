For decades she has been one of our best-loved writers and performers. The television series she\u0027s made - including Acorn Antiques, Dinnerladies and Housewife 49 - have won her a devoted following as well as stacks of awards. \r\n\r\nBut, in a moving and open interview, she describes how, as a teenager, she felt she was a misfit - she had few friends, she struggled with her weight and at school she used to steal other people\u0027s homework. She joined a youth theatre and it was, she says, the saving of her. She found like-minded people and a sense that she had something to offer.\r\n\r\nShe is very careful about how much of her own life she puts into her work. She doesn\u0027t mind saying she cuts her pubic hair with nail-scissors, but rarely discusses her children on the stage. Now she is embarking on her next project. She says she is too anxious to talk about it, except to say it will look at the life of a middle-aged woman whose marriage has foundered.\r\n\r\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\r\n\r\nFavourite track: What a Fool Believes by The Doobie Brothers\r\nBook: A big book by Charles Dickens\r\nLuxury: A bumper book of Sudoku with blank pages \u0026 pens.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-23T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Victoria Wood"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008gh41","title":"Paul Weller","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-16T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b008hyk1","title":"Karren Brady","first_broadcast_date":"2007-12-30T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b008k3n1","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp03b","duration":2134,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
