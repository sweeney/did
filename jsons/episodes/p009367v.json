Sir Bobby Robson is one of the most enduring and popular faces in football. For more than five decades he has dedicated his life to the game - as a player and manager. As a small boy growing up in a mining village in County Durham, he learnt his ball skills by playing football in the streets and backyard with his four brothers.\n\nBy the time he was 15, Bobby knew he had a particular gift and was attracting the attention of the local talent scouts. But, despite being offered a professional place by his home team of Newcastle, he decided to head south to Fulham, where he thought he\u0027d have a greater chance to shine. He went on to play successfully for Fulham and West Bromwich Albion and earned twenty England caps before an ankle injury cut short his international career. He then managed Ipswich Town for 13 very successful years - leaving when he was offered the opportunity manage the England squad. After a successful career in Europe he returned to Britain in 1999 to manage Newcastle but was sacked early in the season. Despite health problems, he says he hasn\u0027t given up hope of finding another club to manage. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: It Was a Very Good Year by Robbie Williams and Frank Sinatra\nBook: The works of historian John Keegan: The First World War \u0026 the Second World War collected into one volume by John Keegan\nLuxury: Sun lounger with canopy to protect him from the sun","first_broadcast_date":"2004-12-05T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Bobby Robson"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009368q","title":"Tracey Emin","first_broadcast_date":"2004-11-28T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009366t","title":"John Fortune","first_broadcast_date":"2004-12-12T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009367w","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz0v","duration":2178,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
