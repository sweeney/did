A versatile musician, he is equally at home playing jazz, writing film scores or composing for the concert hall. He wants to give performers music which they want to play, so he has written percussion pieces for Evelyn Glennie and saxophone sonatas for John Harle and Stan Getz. \u0022Nobody,\u0022 he says, \u0022needs another violin concerto from anybody\u0022. His film scores include Murder on the Orient Express, Far From the Madding Crowd and Four Weddings and a Funeral, but he confesses to having most fun when he\u0027s just singing jazz.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Violin Concerto by William Walton\nBook: The Atlantic book of British and American Poetry  by Edith Sitwell\nLuxury: 6mm 36 inch circular knitting needle with a point at each end","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-19T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Richard Rodney Bennett"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094415","title":"Rose Tremain","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-12T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00943z4","title":"Richard Mabey","first_broadcast_date":"1997-10-26T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094400","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfy1","duration":1937,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
