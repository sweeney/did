His role as Sergeant Brodie in Homeland saw him win both an Emmy and Golden Globe and along with Band of Brothers, The Forsyte Saga and a long list of other credits, he now ranks as one of our most well recognised and highly regarded performers.\n\nThings didn\u0027t always look so peachy: aged 11, and in the school production of Princess Ida, he forgot the entire third act and stood mute in front of a packed auditorium. Tellingly, rather than scuttling into the wings with shame he soldiered on and by 16 he knew performing was, more than anything, what he wanted to do.\n\nHe says, \u0022I am a person who is ambitious. I\u0027m ambitious to get the very best from every moment and even if that\u0027s just taking my children to the zoo ... I want it to be the best it can be.\u0022.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-30T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Damian Lewis"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04pr6rz","title":"Rt Hon Theresa May","first_broadcast_date":"2014-11-23T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04tckjf","title":"Julie Bentley","first_broadcast_date":"2014-12-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04stgww","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pny9x","duration":2125,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
