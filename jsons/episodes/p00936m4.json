He took over as music director of the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden two years ago following in the footsteps of Bernard Haitink and the late Sir Georg Solti. Observers have pointed to a noticeable shift in leadership since his arrival describing him as the \u0027Mr Motivator\u0027 of the opera world. He\u0027s also earned a reputation for being able to attract and nurture some of the industry\u0027s most difficult stars. \n\nHe was born in 1959 in Epping, although his parents were originally from the Campania region of Italy near Naples. The family soon moved to Clapham in South London where Antonio\u0027s father worked as a singing coach at a studio in Pimlico. As a boy he studied the piano and, by the age of ten, was his father\u0027s regular accompanist. When he was 13, the family moved to Connecticut in America, where he organised school and church choirs and played the piano in a local cocktail bar. He didn\u0027t take the traditional career path into the world of opera through college and conservatoire but was sufficiently gifted to become a rehearsal pianist at the New York City Opera by the age of 21. He began to conduct, and soon came to the attention of Daniel Barenboim, who took him on as his assistant. From there he moved to the Opera House in Oslo and, by the age of 32, he was appointed musical director of the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels where he stayed until his move to the Royal Opera House two years ago.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Young and Foolish by Tony Bennett and Bill Evans\nBook: Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain\nLuxury: A piano","first_broadcast_date":"2004-04-25T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Antonio Pappano"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936mt","title":"Bernard Cornwell","first_broadcast_date":"2004-04-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00936ld","title":"Graham Norton","first_broadcast_date":"2004-05-02T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00936m7","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz2r","duration":2142,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
