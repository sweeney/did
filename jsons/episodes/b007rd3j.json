Known these days as \u0027Africa\u0027s Forest Goddess\u0027 for her pioneering work fighting soil erosion and poverty across the continent, she\u0027s united her passion for the power of nature with a crusade for political justice. \n\nBorn the third of six children in the central highlands of Kenya, the family home was a traditional mud-walled house with no electricity or running water. From there, her journey has been extraordinary - she won a scholarship to America, became a professor and launched the Greenbelt Movement which has educated and encouraged African women to plant millions of trees. She has campaigned against the erosion of human rights in Kenya and in 2004 she became the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: I Can\u0027t Complain by Patti LaBelle\nBook: The Koran \nLuxury: A huge basket of fruit.","first_broadcast_date":"2007-07-01T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Wangari Maathai"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007qsrj","title":"Ricky Gervais","first_broadcast_date":"2007-06-24T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b007rwff","title":"Simon Russell Beale","first_broadcast_date":"2007-07-08T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b007rd1t","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp05m","duration":2094,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00066","key":"music","title":"Music","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
