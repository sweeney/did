Ian Rankin is an award-winning writer of crime fiction and the creator of the Scottish detective John Rebus who has featured in 17 novels to date. \n\nBorn in Fife, Rankin came from a working-class background in a coal-mining town where he says he spent most of his childhood trying to \u0022look like he fitted in\u0022. In his bedroom he would live out a fantasy life, writing poems, stories and creating strip-cartoons. He admits there are many parallels between himself and Rebus - they lived at the same Edinburgh address, both are fond of a drink and now they even share the same taste in music, though unlike Rebus, Rankin has never smoked. However all that is about to change; Rebus has reached the age of retirement in the police force and Rankin\u0027s next novel will be the last in the series.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Solid Air by John Martyn\nBook: A Dance to the Music of Time by Anthony Powell\nLuxury: Pinball machine (traditional American one)","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-16T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Ian Rankin"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vd5","title":"Monty Don","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-09T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0093vbf","title":"Dr Hanna Segal","first_broadcast_date":"2006-07-23T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0093vcd","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0b1","duration":2015,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
