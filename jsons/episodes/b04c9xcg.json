Yet his image is that of an everyday, low key, unassuming bloke ... except that he isn\u0027t, he\u0027s penning and performing songs filled with intimacy, optimism and lyricism, that strike a chord with millions of fans.\n\nFor a long while his devotees were well versed in the art of delayed gratification - Elbow\u0027s debut album was released 11 years after the band members first made music together.\n\nHe writes his songs in his journal and has been keeping a diary since he was 14. Maybe it was the peace and calm of the blank page that first appealed - one of 7 kids he says he was brought up \u0022in a house full of women that were singing, shouting, arguing, fighting over the bathroom. I\u0027m ruined by these women, spoilt rotten\u0022.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-08-03T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Guy Garvey"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04bmdf7","title":"Dame Wendy Hall","first_broadcast_date":"2014-07-27T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b04d0xfx","title":"Malcolm Gladwell","first_broadcast_date":"2014-08-10T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b04c9tk2","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyc6","duration":2221,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
