A versatile actress, she\u0027s been the femme fatal in films like Body Heat, parodied that role in comedies like Serial Mom, and played the romantic adventurer in Romancing the Stone. But, she says, \u0027\u0027I never play the victim, because I\u0027m not attracted to a woman who doesn\u0027t try\u0027\u0027. It\u0027s an attitude which must have helped her when she developed rheumatoid arthritis which left her severely bloated and in pain. Presently wowing audiences as Mrs Robinson in London\u0027s West End production of The Graduate, she chooses eight records to take to the mythical island.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Piano Concerto No 1 in B flat minor by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\nBook: Emma by Jane Austen\nLuxury: Roses","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-14T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Kathleen Turner"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949y8","title":"Sir John Mills","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-07T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00949ws","title":"Dame Norma Major","first_broadcast_date":"2000-05-21T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00949xk","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnznf","duration":2006,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
