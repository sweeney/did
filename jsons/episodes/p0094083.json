The author of Good Behaviour, Time After Time and Loving and Giving, she began writing in the early 20s using the pseudonym MJ Farrell to conceal her identity from her sporting friends in Ireland, where she was born and grew up. It was a world of snobbery and decaying aristocracy which she portrays in her books with excruciating accuracy.\nThen, after a period in the early 50s as a successful playwright, she fell silent, to emerge 25 years later under her real name, Molly Keane, and went on to achieve huge success and literary recognition. Now 86, she\u0027ll be talking to Sue Lawley about her childhood, her books and her Ireland.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Greensleeves by James Galway\nBook: A bound copy of the Spectator magazines\nLuxury: A bed, netted from snakes and flies","first_broadcast_date":"1990-05-13T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Molly Keane"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094091","title":"Prue Leith","first_broadcast_date":"1990-05-06T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009407c","title":"Jonathan Pryce","first_broadcast_date":"1990-05-20T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p0094084","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppcq4","duration":2217,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
