Although driven by a great desire to be a performer, and travelling from one audition to another, she confesses to Sue Lawley that when her big break came, it wasn\u0027t jazz which attracted her, so much as the leader of the band - John Dankworth. Whether he spotted a cheap singer for the night, or recognised a great talent in the making, it was to be the start of a hugely successful partnership both professionally and personally.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Don\u0027t Look Back by Jacqueline Dankworth\nBook: The Jazz Revolution by John Dankworth\nLuxury: Perfume","first_broadcast_date":"1997-08-31T12:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Cleo Laine"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009446p","title":"Iain Banks","first_broadcast_date":"1997-08-24T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094455","title":"Sir Frank Kermode","first_broadcast_date":"1997-09-07T12:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009445z","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfyq","duration":2072,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
