Julian Clary brought camp out of the closet and into the TV mainstream. In the late 1980s he burst onto television screens as The Joan Collins Fan Club, attracting a surprisingly broad audience with his extreme make-up and innuendo. The son of a policeman and a probation officer, Julian was born and brought up in Teddington and Surbiton, and as a child was deeply religious. He discovered his comic talent at Goldsmith\u0027s University in the late 1970s where, as well as taking part in rather serious drama productions, he and a friend created the duo Glad and May - two over-made-up cleaning ladies with a passion for \u0027rummaging\u0027 through the handbags of their hapless audience. \n\nIn recent years, Julian has toned down the make-up and innuendo in order to take on a new role - Julian Clary, family favourite, star of prime time. Where once he had cult status, he now has serious mainstream appeal, recently presenting the new National Lottery show on BBC1 and reaching the final of Strictly Come Dancing.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Garu Nanaka Ji Ki Jai Kar by Dana Gillespie\nBook: Stop Thinking, Start Living by Richard Carlson\nLuxury: All-purpose prosthetic arm","first_broadcast_date":"2005-09-25T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Julian Clary"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935g1","title":"Brenda Blethyn","first_broadcast_date":"2005-09-18T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00935dk","title":"Frank Gardner","first_broadcast_date":"2005-10-02T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00935f8","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pp0dy","duration":2059,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
