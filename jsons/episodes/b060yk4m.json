On the strength of that historic victory he was awarded an MBE for services to the game, and the public voted him BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\n\nBarely out of his pram when he picked up a cricket ball he turned out to bat for an under-14 match when he was just six years old. His debut was not in crisp cricket whites, but in a second hand Manchester United tracksuit, setting the tone for someone who\u0027s made a habit of doing things his way. Not least at a 10 Downing Street reception when, somewhat the worse for wear, he weaved into the cabinet room, plonked himself down in the PM\u0027s chair and knocked back yet another bottle of beer.\n\nSince retiring from the game he\u0027s had a go at heavyweight boxing and won the bout. One area where he hasn\u0027t come out on top: his sons never listen to his cricket coaching tips.\n\nProducer: Sarah Taylor.","first_broadcast_date":"2015-07-05T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Freddie Flintoff"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b0606vtx","title":"Harry Rabinowitz","first_broadcast_date":"2015-06-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b061pgrv","title":"Imtiaz Dharker","first_broadcast_date":"2015-07-12T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b060yh2x","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02w7mxq","duration":2111,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
