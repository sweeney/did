He has turned horse training into a science. His animals have the choice of a swimming pool, indoor canter and walking machine, while the on-site laboratory monitors their temperature, blood and weight throughout the day. Yet he retains his love for the horses themselves - a passion which has made him one of the most successful trainers in Britain.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs] \n\nFavourite track: Oh Carol by Neil Sedaka\nBook: Horse Management by R S Timmis\nLuxury: Winning post from Cheltenham race course","first_broadcast_date":"1999-07-18T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Martin Pipe"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094236","title":"Paddy Moloney","first_broadcast_date":"1999-07-11T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p0094215","title":"Rod Steiger","first_broadcast_date":"1999-07-25T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009422c","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppfpk","duration":2081,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
