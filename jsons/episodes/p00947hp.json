He loved listening to the radio and chose to go to Dartmouth College in preference to Harvard or Yale because it had a student-run commercial college radio station. He soon became a news reporter, DJ and eventually manager. Paul came to England to study PPE at Oxford University and, although he was despondent when the local radio station wouldn\u0027t give him a job, his luck changed following his graduation when he was offered an American Music slot on the recently launched BBC Radio 1. At 24 years of age, he was their youngest broadcaster and stayed with the network for 18 years. \n\nHe has worked on most radio and television networks, including a film review slot, which ran for 13 years, on breakfast television, and presenting the film edition of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Kaleidoscope programme. He has also written a number of books, including co-authoring The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles, which illustrates his remarkable memory for music facts and figures. He now presents America\u0027s Greatest Hits on BBC Radio 2 and Classic Countdown on Classic FM. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: The Finale of Rhapsody in Blue by George Gerhswin\nBook: The complete Carl Barks Library by Carl Barks\nLuxury: A piano","first_broadcast_date":"2002-10-13T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Paul Gambaccini"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947j2","title":"Philip Pullman","first_broadcast_date":"2002-10-06T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p00947hh","title":"Carl Djerassi","first_broadcast_date":"2002-10-20T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p00947hq","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnz8y","duration":2045,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
