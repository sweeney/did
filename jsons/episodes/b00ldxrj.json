From the Rolling Stones to Pavarotti, and with pretty well every other name in music inbetween, he has been one of the country\u0027s top promoters for more than 40 years. His career has given him a unique insight into music history; he was there, after all, when Keith Moon threw his first TV out of a hotel window. Always passionate about what he listened to, he acknowledges that his own instrument is the pocket calculator.\n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: Sing, Sing, Sing (with a Swing) by Benny Goodman\nBook: The Reader\u0027s Digest Complete Do It Yourself Manual\nLuxury: A piano.","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-05T10:00:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Harvey Goldsmith"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00l97zh","title":"Arlene Phillips","first_broadcast_date":"2009-06-28T11:15:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00ljhmb","title":"Prof Hugh Pennington","first_broadcast_date":"2009-07-12T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00ldxmq","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnzwh","duration":2128,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
