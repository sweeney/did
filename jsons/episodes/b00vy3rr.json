Her books, starting with Portrait of Pasta in 1976, helped to change all that, and established her as a food hero for younger cooks like Nigella Lawson and Delia Smith. \n\nShe has still more to teach however: whatever you do, she says, you shouldn\u0027t serve bolognese with spaghetti as it\u0027s just the wrong shape. Tagliatelle is much better. \n\nRecord: Part of the duet from the first act of Otello\nBook: The Leopard by Giuseppe Di Lampedusa\nLuxury: Extra virgin olive oil.","first_broadcast_date":"2010-11-19T09:00:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Anna Del Conte"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00vr9l2","title":"Ian McMillan","first_broadcast_date":"2010-11-07T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b00w1151","title":"Alice Cooper","first_broadcast_date":"2010-11-21T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b00vy3pl","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyzd","duration":2183,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
