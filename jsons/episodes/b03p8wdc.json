Ever since sailing has been his obsession. He\u0027s brave, strong and skilled, but it\u0027s his tactical nouse and maverick streak that sets him apart. In last year\u0027s America\u0027s Cup he turned a 1-8 defeat into a 9-8 win for the US. Whether he can do the same for his home team may be his next big challenge.\n\nHe says, \u0022The desire to win is still the same as ever ... if it wasn\u0027t there, that would be a worry. Motivation has never really been a problem for me.\u0022\n\nProducer: Cathy Drysdale.","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-26T11:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Sir Ben Ainslie"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03q56ks","title":"Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin","first_broadcast_date":"2014-01-19T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b03sr7dy","title":"Bob Harris","first_broadcast_date":"2014-02-02T11:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b03p8wd5","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyfr","duration":2066,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
