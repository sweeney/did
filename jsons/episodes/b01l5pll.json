More than six million copies of her books have now been sold - not bad for a girl who failed her school certificate in English. \nOn television, it is her role as a judge on The Great British Bake-off that has brought her to the attention of a new generation. \nIt was in domestic science lessons that she discovered her love of cooking and she is in no doubt of the importance of teaching cookery in school \u0022When everybody leaves school, whether they are a boy or a girl, what do they have to do in the home? They have to produce a meal. They haven\u0027t been taught to do it. I think it should be essential.\u0022\n\nProducer: Leanne Buckle.","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-29T11:15:00+01:00","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Mary Berry"},"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01ky5gv","title":"Akram Khan","first_broadcast_date":"2012-07-22T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"b01lh96q","title":"Baroness Campbell","first_broadcast_date":"2012-08-05T10:00:00+01:00","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"b01l5pky","duration":2700,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02pnyp8","duration":2215,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
