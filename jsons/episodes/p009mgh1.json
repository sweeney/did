An orphan born in Dublin, she started a career as a dancer at the age of twelve. As a teenager she worked in Germany in the late 1920s and 30s before moving to France. It was there that she formed The Bluebell Girls, a dance troupe which became synonymous with the high life of Paris. She spent the war working with them in Nazi-occupied Paris, hiding her Jewish husband in an attic. In conversation with Michael Parkinson she looks back over her eventful life and career, and chooses her eight favourite records. \n\n[Taken from the original programme material for this archive edition of Desert Island Discs]\n\nFavourite track: There\u0027s No Business Like Show Business by Ethel Merman\nBook: History of the English-Speaking Peoples by Sir Winston Churchill\nLuxury: Her first dress worn on stage","first_broadcast_date":"1988-02-07T12:15:00Z","display_title":{"title":"Desert Island Discs","subtitle":"Margaret Kelly - Miss Bluebell"},"parent":{"programme":{"type":"brand","pid":"b006qnmr","title":"Desert Island Discs","short_synopsis":"Kirsty Young invites her castaway guests to share the soundtrack of their lives.","position":null,"image":{"pid":"p05g24sc"},"expected_child_count":null,"first_broadcast_date":"1942-01-29T19:00:00+01:00","aggregated_episode_count":3147,"ownership":{"service":{"type":"radio","id":"bbc_radio_four","key":"radio4","title":"BBC Radio 4"}}}},"peers":{"previous":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mghr","title":"Lord Donoughue","first_broadcast_date":"1988-01-31T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"},"next":{"type":"episode","pid":"p009mggg","title":"William Davis","first_broadcast_date":"1988-02-14T12:15:00Z","position":null,"media_type":"audio"}},"versions":[{"canonical":1,"pid":"p009mgh2","duration":2400,"types":["Original version"]},{"canonical":0,"pid":"p02ppd3b","duration":1823,"types":["Podcast version"]}],"links":[],"supporting_content_items":[],"categories":[{"type":"format","id":"PT004","key":"discussionandtalk","title":"Discussion \u0026 Talk","narrower":[],"broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null},{"type":"genre","id":"C00050","key":"lifestories","title":"Life Stories","narrower":[],"broader":{"category":{"type":"genre","id":"C00045","key":"factual","title":"Factual","broader":{},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}},"has_topic_page":false,"sameAs":null}]}}
